## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations create three exemptions to section 55NA(1) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act  2000 (c. 8)  (“ the Act ”). The effect of
an exemption is to disapply the general requirement that authorised persons
must not approve the content of a communication for the purposes of section 21
of the Act, unless granted permission by the FCA.

  Regulation 3 of these regulations sets out the three exemptions for where an
unauthorised person communicates a financial promotion. The first is where the
authorised person that approves the communication also prepared the content of
that communication. The second is where the unauthorised person prepared the
content of the communication, and that unauthorised person and the authorised
person that approves that communication are in the same group. The third is
where the content of the communication is prepared by an appointed
representative, that is the unauthorised person, in relation to any regulated
activity that their principal has accepted responsibility for. This exemption
applies where that principal, as an authorised person, approves that
communication.

  A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or
no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
