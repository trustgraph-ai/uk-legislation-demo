However, charges for processing applications for registration as carriers, brokers or dealers in controlled waste are required to be set out in legislation.

## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs publishes a
charging scheme to ensure that as far as practical, fees and charges payable
for waste management licenses under the Waste and Contaminated Land (Northern
Ireland) Order 1997 (the 1997 Order) are sufficient to recover costs for the
Department in exercising its functions under the 1997 Order. However, charges
for processing applications for registration as carriers, brokers or dealers
in controlled waste are required to be set out in legislation. The purpose of
these Regulations is to increase those charges to reflect changes in the value
of money. Details of the increased fees will also be included in the charging
scheme which sets out the fees and charges payable in respect to waste
management licenses.

  These Regulations amend the regulation 4 of the Controlled Waste
(Registration of Carriers and Seizure of Vehicles) Regulations (Northern
Ireland) 1999, which sets out the process concerning applications for
registration as a carrier of controlled waste, including the associated fees.

  Also amended is paragraph 3(10) of Schedule 4 to the Waste Management
Licensing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003, which sets out fees in relation
to the registration of brokers and dealers in controlled waste.
