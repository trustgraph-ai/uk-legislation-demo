## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations authorise the placing on the market, in Wales, of
specified genetically modified food and feed products for the purposes of
Regulation  (EC) No 1829/2003  on genetically modified food and feed (EUR
2003/1829). These Regulations also modify the “authorisation holders” for 18
existing authorisations under EUR 2003/1829.

  Part 2 of these Regulations (regulation 3 and Schedules 1 to 8) contains the
authorisation, in relation to Wales, for the placing on the market of products
containing, consisting of, or produced from the specified genetically modified
organisms—         Schedule 1 is a new authorisation for genetically modified
soybean DAS-81419-2 × DAS-44406-6;           Schedule 2 is a new authorisation
for genetically modified soybean DAS-81419-2;           Schedule 3 is a new
authorisation for genetically modified soybean SYHT0H2;           Schedule 4
is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 87427 × MON 87460 ×
MON 89034 × 1507 × MON 87411 × 59122 and listed sub-combinations;
Schedule 5 is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize 1507 × MIR162
× MON 810 × NK603 and listed sub-combinations;           Schedule 6 is a new
authorisation for genetically modified cotton GHB614 × T304-40 × GHB119;
Schedule 7 renews the authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 88017 ×
MON 810;           Schedule 8 renews an authorisation for genetically modified
oilseed rape GT73. This renewal is limited to products (other than food)
containing or consisting of genetically modified oilseed rape GT73. It does
not cover products “produced from” that genetically modified organism.

  Part 3 of these Regulations (regulations 4 to 21) amends, in relation to
Wales, 18 retained EU Decisions containing existing authorisations for
genetically modified food and feed. The amendments all relate to changes to
the names and addresses of the respective authorisation holders, and their
representatives in Great Britain.
