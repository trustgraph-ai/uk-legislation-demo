## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas
Visitors) Regulations 1989 ( S.I. 1989/306 ) (“ the Principal Regulations ”),
which provide for the making and recovery of charges for relevant services
provided under the National Health Service (Wales) Act  2006 (c. 42)  to
overseas visitors.

  Regulation 2 amends regulation 4D of the Principal Regulations, which is
concerned with charges for the provision of healthcare services to individuals
who have made a late application for leave to enter or remain in the United
Kingdom under the European Union Settlement Scheme (“ EUSS ”). The amendments
provide that individuals who have made such an application, but have not been
granted EUSS pre-settled or settled status, must not be charged for relevant
healthcare services provided to them whilst their application is under
consideration, and that any charges for such services—         if already
made, must not be recovered,           if already paid, must be repaid.

  The Welsh Ministers’ code of practice on the carrying out of regulatory
impact assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a
result a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs
and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from
the Department of Health and Social Services, Welsh Government, Cathays Park,
