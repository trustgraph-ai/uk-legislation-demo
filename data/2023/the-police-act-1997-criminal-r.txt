## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations amend the Police Act 1997 (Criminal Records) (Disclosure)
Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2008 (“ the 2008 Regulations ”) to make
provision for enhanced criminal record checks with suitability information in
relation to individuals who are seeking to act as an adult placement carer in
accordance with the Adult Placement Agencies Regulations (Northern Ireland)
2007.

  The 2008 Regulations make detailed provision in relation to applications for
criminal conviction certificates, criminal record certificates and enhanced
criminal record certificates under Part 5 of the Police Act 1997 (“ the 1997
Act ”). Regulation 9 of the 2008 Regulations prescribes the purposes for which
an enhanced criminal record certificate may be required. Regulation 9B
prescribes the cases in which an enhanced criminal record certificate must
also include suitability information relating to adults.

  Regulation 2(2) of these Regulations amends regulation 9 of the 2008
Regulations, creating a new prescribed purpose for which an enhanced criminal
record certificate may be required. The effect of the amendment is to enable
enhanced criminal record checks to be carried out in relation to individuals
who are seeking to act as an adult placement carer, as well as any person
living in the same household as an adult placement carer.

  Regulations 2(3) amends regulation 9B of the 2008 Regulations, to make
provision for checks on suitability information (barred list information) in
respect of vulnerable adults, for the new prescribed purpose set out in
regulation 2(2).

  Regulation 2(4) amends regulation 12 of the 2008 Regulations, to extend
eligibility for an enhanced check to those under the age of 16 who reside in
the same household where the adult placement is taking place.
