intention appears, as being capable of being exercised to modify (or, as the
case may be, result in the modification of) any retained direct EU legislation
or anything which is retained EU law by virtue of section 4.

9.6.11B.3

But  sub-paragraph (2)  enables a power in retained direct minor EU
legislation to be exercised to modify (or result in the modification of) any
retained direct principal EU legislation or anything which is retained EU law
by virtue of section 4 only if—

9.6.11B.3.a

the modification is—

9.6.11B.3.a.i

consistent with any retained direct principal EU legislation or anything which
is retained EU law by virtue of section 4, and

9.6.11B.3.a.ii

supplementary, incidental or consequential in connection with any modification
of any retained direct minor EU legislation, or

9.6.11B.3.b

the power is a power to make, confirm or approve transitional, transitory or
saving provision.

9.6.11B.4

For the purposes of  sub-paragraph (2) , there is no contrary intention merely
because a power is expressed as being capable of being exercised—

9.6.11B.4.a

to modify all enactments or a particular category of enactments, or

9.6.11B.4.b

to make a particular category of modifications to all enactments or to a
particular category of enactments.

9.7

In paragraph 12—

9.7.a

in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) for “10 and 11” substitute  “ 11A  and  11B ” ;

9.7.b

after sub-paragraph (3) insert—

9.7.b.4

Sub-paragraph (5)  applies in relation to a power if—

9.7.b.4.a

paragraph 11A  applies in relation to the power, and

9.7.b.4.b

immediately before the coming into force of  section 9  of the Retained EU Law
(Revocation and Reform) Act 2023, and by virtue of a combination of provision
in the power and paragraph 10 or 11 as it then had effect, the power was
capable of being exercised to modify (or, as the case may be, result in the
modification of) any retained direct EU legislation or anything which is
retained EU law by virtue of section 4.

9.7.b.5

The continued existence of the provision in the power does not prevent the
context from permitting or requiring the power to be read in accordance with
paragraph 11A  so far as the reading provided for by that paragraph is not
provided for by the provision concerned (and, accordingly, the power continues
to be capable of being exercised as mentioned in  sub-paragraph (4)  on and
after the coming into force of  section 9  of the Retained EU Law (Revocation
and Reform) Act 2023).

9.8

Part 1  of  Schedule 3  contains amendments altering the parliamentary
procedure applicable to certain powers when they modify retained direct EU
legislation.

9.9

Part 2  of that Schedule contains amendments consequential on the amendments
made by this section.
