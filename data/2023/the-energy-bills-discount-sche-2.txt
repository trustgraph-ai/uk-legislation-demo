### Discounted supply price

#### Determination of prices

##### Supply price

8

8.1

In these Regulations “ supply price ” in relation to a supply contract means—

the price (before the application of a discount under the scheme) of energy
supplied under that contract, so far as that price is to be paid in respect of
the quantity of energy supplied in any period, or

8.1.b

if the supply contract provides for different prices to be paid in respect of
different quantities of energy (whether supplied in different periods, or at
different times of day or measured by different meters, or otherwise), the
average of such prices—

8.1.b.i

weighted by the quantities supplied to which each such price applies, or

8.1.b.ii

where applicable, and to the extent that determining the average under sub-
paragraph (b)(i) is not practicable, weighted by the number of hours in the
day for which each such price applies.

8.2

The supply price does not include amounts in respect of—

8.2.a

value added tax;

8.2.b

climate change levy, as defined in section 30 of, and Schedule 6 to, the
Finance Act 2000 .

##### Reference wholesale price – fixed price, variable price and DAI price contracts

9

The Secretary of State must establish and publish a methodology for
determining reference wholesale prices applicable to fixed price contracts,
variable price contracts and DAI price contracts.

9.2

The methodology may—

9.2.a

make different provision in respect of fixed price contracts, variable price
contracts and DAI price contracts;

9.2.b

in relation to a fixed price contract, make reference to the price-fix date of
that contract;

9.2.c

provide, in relation to any category of supply contract, for a reference
wholesale price to be determined for the whole of a scheme period or for
different reference wholesale prices to be determined for different periods
within a scheme period;

9.2.d

refer to published quotations of wholesale prices for electricity or gas
traded in the wholesale markets at different times and for delivery at
different times.

9.3

The methodology must not refer to—

9.3.a

any particular details of a variable price contract or a DAI price contract;

9.3.b

any particular details of a fixed price contract other than the price-fix
date.

9.4

Where the methodology provides, in relation to a category of supply contract,
for more than one reference wholesale price to be determined—

9.4.a

subject to paragraph (b), the methodology must provide for how it is to be
determined which of those reference wholesale prices applies to any particular
supply contract in that category;

9.4.b

in relation to a DAI price contract, the methodology may provide for different
reference wholesale prices to apply in different periods.

9.5

The Secretary of State must determine in accordance with the methodology, and
publish at times decided by the Secretary of State, the reference wholesale
prices for variable price contracts, fixed price contracts and DAI price
contracts.

9.6

The Secretary of State may amend the methodology by publishing the amendment.

9.7

Where, in accordance with the methodology or any amendment of it, the
Secretary of State revises any wholesale reference price which has already
been determined in respect of variable price contracts—

9.7.a

the Secretary of State must publish the date on which the revision takes
effect (“effective date”) which must not be earlier than the date on which the
revised price was published;

9.7.b

the revised wholesale reference price—

9.7.b.i

applies in respect of variable price contracts entered into on or after the
effective date;

9.7.b.ii

where so determined by the Secretary of State, applies in respect of energy
supplied on and after the effective date under variable price contracts
entered into before that date.

##### Reference wholesale price – flexible price contracts

10

10.1

In relation to a flexible price contract, the reference wholesale price for
any period in which energy is supplied (a “relevant period”) is the volume-
weighted average contracted wholesale price for the relevant period.

10.2

The volume-weighted average contracted wholesale price for a relevant period
is determined by reference to any of the following that apply under that
contract—

10.2.a

any elections (and the quantities, periods and prices subject to those
elections) made by the customer to fix the contracted wholesale price;

10.2.b

any cancellations by the customer of such an election;

10.2.c

any amounts (so far as relating to wholesale prices) payable by or to the
customer in respect of such elections or cancellations;

10.2.d

any amounts payable by the customer in respect of quantities of energy in
default of such elections;

10.2.e

the quantities, periods and prices on the basis of which the contracted
wholesale price was fixed under any other mechanism under the contract;

10.2.f

other amounts referable to the wholesale cost of electricity in accordance
with the principle in paragraph (3),

each so far as attributable to energy supplied under the contract in the
relevant period.

10.3

The principle is that amounts payable by the customer under the supply
contract—

10.3.a

should be included in the contracted wholesale price where such payment has
the effect of passing through to the customer a cost or risk incurred by the
supplier and related to the cost of wholesale energy;

10.3.b

should not be included in the contracted wholesale price where such amount is
payable to compensate or reward the supplier for bearing, and not passing
through to the customer, such a cost or risk.

10.4

A supplier must—

10.4.a

establish a methodology setting out the basis on which it will determine the
reference wholesale price under each flexible price contract, or each kind of
flexible price contract, that it enters or has entered into;

10.4.b

keep the methodology under review and update it if appropriate;

10.4.c

maintain, in respect of each flexible price contract, the data necessary to
make those determinations in accordance with the relevant methodology;

10.4.d

apply the relevant methodology in making those determinations.

10.5

The Secretary of State may make rules about the determination (including as to
what is, and what is not, to be taken into account in the determination) of
volume-weighted average contracted wholesale prices in respect of flexible
supply contracts in accordance with this regulation.

#### Categorisation of supply contracts

##### Duty of supplier to categorise contracts

11

11.1

A supplier must, in respect of each of its supply contracts—

11.1.a

determine whether it is a fixed price contract, a flexible price contract, a
variable price contract or a DAI price contract (each being a “category” of
supply contract);

11.1.b

in the case of a fixed price contract—

11.1.b.i

determine the price-fix date;

11.1.b.ii

determine whether it is an excluded fixed price contract.

11.1.c

in circumstances specified in rules made under paragraph (6), determine
whether it is to be treated as comprising more than one supply contract, and
if so, on what basis.

11.2

If a supplier determines that a supply contract is required by any provision
of these Regulations or rules made under them to be treated as comprising more
than one supply contract, paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) apply separately to each
such contract.

11.3

A supplier must give notice to the customer of the determinations made under
paragraph (1).

11.4

The determinations in respect of a supply contract under paragraph (1) must be
made and notice under paragraph (3) given by the later of the scheme
introduction date and the time at which the supply contract is entered into.

11.5

A supplier must apply the methodology established and updated from time to
time in accordance with regulation 12 in making the determinations under
paragraph (1).

11.6

The Secretary of State may make rules—

11.6.a

about the basis on which it is to be determined whether a supply contract is a
fixed price contract, a variable price contract, a flexible price contract or
a DAI price contract;

11.6.b

about the basis on which the price-fix date of a fixed price contract is to be
determined;

11.6.c

specifying circumstances in which a supply contract must be treated for the
purposes of the scheme as comprising, as to different portions of the energy
supplied under it, more than one contract, and, for these purposes, the two or
more contracts which it is to be treated as comprising may be of the same or
different categories referred to in paragraph 1(a).

##### Methodology for contract categorisation

12

A supplier must—

12.a

establish a methodology setting out the basis on which it will make the
determinations under regulation 11(1);

keep the methodology under review and update it if appropriate, having regard
in particular to—

12.b.i

any change in the basis or terms on which it enters or offers to enter into
supply contracts;

12.d

ensure that it has in place reliable systems and procedures to apply the
methodology.

##### Treatment of supply contracts

13

13.1

A supply contract is to be treated for all purposes of the scheme as a fixed
price contract, flexible price contract, variable price contract or DAI price
contract, according to the category that the supplier (or the Secretary of
State, under regulation 74) has determined that it falls into.

13.2

Paragraph (1) is subject to any rule made under regulation 11(6)(a) or (c).

13.3

If a contract between a supplier and customer provides for the supply of both
electricity and gas, it must be treated for the purposes of these Regulations
as comprising separate supply contracts for electricity and gas respectively.

##### Treatment of fixed price contracts at end of term

14

14.1

Paragraph (2) applies where, as a result of a relevant amendment of a fixed
price contract, the contracted wholesale price is fixed under the new contract
for any period starting at or after the end of the original fixed term.

14.2

The new contract is to be treated for the purposes of the scheme as a new
fixed price contract for which the price-fix date is determined by reference
to the time when the relevant amendment was made.

14.3

Paragraph (4) applies where, as a result of a relevant amendment of a fixed
price contract, at any time before the end of the original fixed term, the
contracted wholesale price fixed under the new contract differs from the
contracted wholesale price under the original contract.

14.4

Until the end of the original fixed term, the base discount applicable in
respect of the new contract is the base discount that was applicable to the
original contract.

14.5

Where with effect from the end of the original fixed term—

14.5.a

a supply contract continues in force, and

14.5.b

the contracted wholesale price is not fixed for any period after the original
fixed term,

the contract is to be treated as a variable price contract entered into at the
time of any relevant amendment to it or (in the absence of any relevant
amendment) at the end of the original fixed term.

14.6

In this regulation, in respect of a fixed price contract—

14.6.a

“ new contract ” means the contract which results from the relevant amendment;

14.6.b

“ original contract ” means the fixed price contract before the relevant
amendment;

14.6.c

“ original fixed term ” means the term for which the contracted wholesale
price was fixed under the original contract;

14.6.d

“ relevant amendment ” means any amendment, extension or variation of the

proportion for a benefit calculation period in accordance with paragraph (4),
the provider must rely on the notifications given to it by lower-tier
providers as to their ETII proportions or QHS proportions for that period.

21.6

For the purposes of this regulation, there is a “ benefit redetermination
event ” in relation to a main scheme provider and a benefit calculation period
where, after the provider has determined or redetermined (under paragraph
(1)(b) or (4)) and, where applicable, notified to a higher-level provider the
ETII proportion or the QHS proportion for that benefit calculation period, any
of the following occurs—

21.6.a

the provider receives an ETII certificate or QHS certificate relating to a
person (and heat network, in the case of a QHS certificate) who was not
previously counted as a certified ETII operator or certified heat supplier in
relation to that heat network in determining such ETII proportion or QHS
proportion, and the certification date of such certificate is earlier than the
end of the benefit calculation period;

21.6.b

the Secretary of State determines such ETII proportion or QHS proportion under
regulation 74;

21.6.e

the provider is notified by a lower-tier provider of any redetermination of an
ETII proportion or QHS proportion in respect of that benefit calculation
period.

##### ETII and QHS proportions

22

22.1

The ETII proportion and the QHS proportion applying for any period in respect
of a customer or main scheme provider are determined as follows—

22.1.a

the ETII proportion in respect of a customer which is a certified ETII
operator and is not a provider, is 1;

22.1.b

the ETII proportion in respect of a main scheme provider (P), is a proportion
of the base scheme benefit for that period calculated as—

        A + B / C

22.1.c

the QHS proportion in respect of a main scheme provider (P), is a proportion
of the base scheme benefit for that period calculated as—

        D / C               Where—         A, if P is a certified ETII
operator, is that part of the base scheme benefit which is not required to be
passed on by P to any person, and, if P is not a certified ETII operator, is
zero;           B is that part of the base scheme benefit which is required to
be passed on (by any immediate ETII provider, whether or not that is P) to
certified ETII operators;           C is the base scheme benefit;           D
is that part of the base scheme benefit which is required to be passed on (by
any certified heat supplier, whether or not that is P) to qualifying heat
consumers;         provided that if a qualifying heat consumer is also a
certified ETII operator, the amount of base scheme benefit required to be
passed on to it—         is counted in determining D, and           is not
counted in determining B.

22.2

In this regulation “ base scheme benefit ” means, in respect of a main scheme
provider (P), for any period, the scheme benefit, calculated as if the GSP
decrement and the MD increment were zero, and as if the government supported
price and maximum discount for QHS supply contracts were equal to the
government supported price and maximum discount for general supply contracts,
that would be provided for that period to P—

22.2.a

where P is the customer, by way of discount under the supply contract;

22.2.b

where P is not the customer, from a higher-tier provider required to pass on
such benefit to P.

##### Separate supply contracts

23

23.1

A supplier must treat a relevant supply contract as comprising up to three
contracts, as follows—

23.1.a

a single supply contract in respect of all energy supplied or otherwise made
available to, or used to make available heating, hot water or electricity to,
certified ETII operators (an “ETII supply contract”);

23.1.b

a single supply contract in respect of all energy supplied or otherwise made
available to, or used to make available heating or hot water to, certified
heat suppliers (a “QHS supply contract”);

23.1.c

a single supply contract in respect of so much (if any) of the energy supplied
as is not treated as supplied under the ETII supply contract or the QHS supply
contract.

23.2

Each supply contract within paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) is a “ deemed supply
contract ” for the purposes of this Chapter.

23.3

Where under rules made under regulation 11(6)(c) a supply contract is to be
treated as comprising more than one supply contract—

23.3.a

paragraph (1) applies separately in relation to each of those supply
contracts;

23.3.b

the question which one or more of those supply contracts is to be treated as a
relevant supply contract is to be determined in accordance with those rules.

23.4

Subject to paragraph (6), the supplier must treat the ETII proportion,
applying in respect of the customer, of the supplied energy in any period as
the energy supplied in that period under the ETII supply contract.

23.5

Subject to paragraph (7), the supplier must treat the QHS proportion, applying
in respect of the customer, of the supplied energy in any period as the energy
supplied in that period under the QHS supply contract.

23.6

Where in accordance with rules the supplier identifies a specified discrepancy

wholesale price applicable to that supply contract for P, subject to paragraph
(4);           GSP is the government supported price applicable to that supply
contract;           GSPD is the GSP decrement.

28.2

The Secretary of State must determine the base discounts and (for ETII supply
contracts) increased discounts for fixed price contracts, variable price
contracts and DAI price contracts, and publish them with the corresponding
reference wholesale prices.

28.3

Where regulation 58 applies, the base discount is reduced and (for an ETII
supply contract) the increased discount is reduced in accordance with that

28.4

Where paragraph (1) of regulation 49 applies, the reference wholesale price is
determined under sub-paragraph (c) of that paragraph.

##### Calculation of discount

29

29.1

For the purposes of these Regulations, “ the discount ” means the reduction
(in p/kWh) in the supply price under a supply contract to be applied pursuant
to the scheme in respect of that contract for any period.

29.2

In the case of a general supply contract or a QHS supply contract, the
discount is calculated as follows—

        max ⁡ min ⁡ BD , MD , SP - MP , 0               Where—         BD is
the base discount in respect of that supply contract for the period;
MD is the maximum discount applicable to that supply contract;           SP is
the supply price for the period;           MP is the minimum supply price
applicable to that supply contract.

29.3

In the case of an ETII supply contract the discount is calculated as follows—

        0.3 max ⁡ min ⁡ BD , MD , SP - MP , 0 + 0.7 max ⁡ min ⁡ ID ,   IMB ,
SP - RMP , 0               Where—         BD is the base discount in respect
of that supply contract for the period;           MD is the maximum discount
applicable to that supply contract);           SP is the supply price for the
period;           MP is the minimum supply price applicable to that supply
contract;           ID is the increased discount in respect of that supply
contract for the period;           IMD is the maximum discount applicable to
an ETII supply contract plus the MD increment;           RMP is the minimum
supply price applicable to an ETII supply contract less the GSP decrement.

##### Duty of suppliers to provide the discount

where a customer takes its supply through a prepayment meter, the prepayment
meter is set or reset, or other arrangements are made, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the scheme introduction date, and thereafter whenever
required, to ensure that the amounts paid by the customer over each scheme
period reflect charges at the discounted supply price for supply in the scheme
period.

38.3

If—

38.3.a

the Secretary of State withholds payment under regulation 37(1)(c), and

38.3.b

the supplier provides the supporting information or (as the case may be)
correct supporting information,

the Secretary of State must, within a reasonable time, release the amount

the Secretary of State withholds payment under regulation 37(1)(d), and

38.4.b

the supplier demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that
the supplier has taken the measures referred to in regulation 37(4)(b),

the Secretary of State must, within a reasonable time, release the amount
withheld, less any amount established not to be payable by the Secretary of
State.

38.5

If the Secretary of State withholds payment under regulation 37(1)(e)—

38.5.a

#### Reconciliation run-off

##### Reconciliation run-off

39

39.1

This regulation provides for reconciliation and adjustment to continue, after
the scheme end date, in respect of claims for discount recovery in respect of
periods of supply within either scheme period.

39.2

The provisions of this Part continue to apply, on the basis set out in
paragraph (3), with effect from the scheme end date until the reconciliation
run-off date.

39.3

No day after the scheme end date is counted in any period of supply in respect
of any supply contract, and accordingly there is no base recovery amount in
respect of any period after the scheme end date.

39.4

Unless otherwise permitted by the Secretary of State, a supplier must submit a
discount recovery claim in each claim window in the reconciliation run-off
period.

39.5

The Secretary of State must determine, in respect of each supplier or some or
all suppliers collectively, the date after which it is not likely that any
material amounts will be calculated under regulation 33(1)(b) (such date, in
respect of a supplier, “the reconciliation run off date”), and give notice to
the supplier or suppliers of that date.

39.6

In this regulation—

39.6.a

the “reconciliation run-off period” is the period beginning with the day after
the scheme end date and ending with the reconciliation run-off date;

39.6.b

the “scheme end date” is—

39.6.b.i

in relation to a supplier who ceases to hold an electricity supply licence or
gas supply licence, the date on which the supplier ceases to hold that
licence;

39.6.b.ii

in relation to any other supplier, the last day of the second scheme period.

#### Procedure for discount recovery

##### Submission of a valid discount recovery claim

40

40.1

A supplier may apply for discount recovery by submitting a discount recovery
claim to the Secretary of State, setting out—

40.1.a

the date on which the claim is submitted;

40.1.b

the supply contracts in respect of which discount recovery is claimed;

40.1.c

for each such supply contract—

40.1.c.i

the period of supply to which the claim relates, and

40.1.c.ii

the supply contract recovery amount;

40.1.d

any amount carried forward from the preceding discount recovery claim under
regulation 34(3)(b);

40.1.e

the details required under regulation 42 in respect of any supply contract;

40.1.f

details of any opt-out notice which has been given or withdrawn by a customer
since—

40.1.f.i

the preceding discount recovery claim, or

40.1.f.ii

in the case of the first such claim, the scheme introduction date,

40.1.g

the recovery claim amount.

40.2

A supplier may submit only one discount recovery claim, relating to all supply
contracts for which it claims discount recovery, in any claim window.

40.3

But paragraph (2) does not prevent the supplier from submitting a replacement
discount recovery claim as provided in regulation 41(1) in any claim window.

40.4

A valid discount recovery claim is one that meets—

40.4.a

the requirements in this regulation, and

40.4.b

the further requirements for a valid discount recovery claim set out in the
discount recovery rules.

##### Invalid, erroneous or absent discount recovery claims

41

41.1

Where the Secretary of State considers that a claim submitted by a supplier is
not a valid discount recovery claim, the Secretary of State may—

41.1.a

decline to make any payment in respect of it, or

41.1.b

elect to pay part only of the amount claimed,

until the invalidity is corrected or the claim is replaced by a valid discount
recovery claim.

41.2

Where the Secretary of State considers that a discount recovery claim is valid
but any amount set out in the claim is erroneously stated—

41.2.a

the Secretary of State, after taking reasonable steps to resolve the matter
with the supplier, may adjust the amount of the claim to reflect what the
Secretary of State considers to be the correct amount;

41.2.b

the amount payable under regulation 34 by or to the Secretary of State in
respect of the discount recovery claim is the adjusted amount under sub-
paragraph (a).

41.3

If in a claim window a supplier does not submit a discount recovery claim, and
the Secretary of State considers that, if a claim had been submitted on the
last day of the claim window, the recovery claim amount, calculated
disregarding any base recovery amount, would be an amount payable to the
Secretary of State—

41.3.a

the Secretary of State may give notice to the supplier setting out that
recovery claim amount and details of how it was calculated;

41.3.b

the notice is to be treated as a valid discount recovery claim for the
purposes of this Chapter.

##### Reporting details of Part 4 arrangements

42

42.1

A supplier must include, in each discount recovery claim that it submits—

42.1.a

each declaration received from a customer under regulation 48(1)(b), 53(1)(b)

since the preceding discount recovery claim (or in the case of the first,
since the scheme introduction date);

42.1.b

details of any customer to which, since the preceding discount recovery claim
(or in the case of the first, since the scheme introduction date), the
supplier has given notice under regulation 48(2)(b), regulation 53(2)(b) or
regulation 62(2)(b) unless the customer has either sent a declaration (as
referred to in sub-paragraph (a)) or confirmed to the supplier in writing that
the Chapter under which the supplier gave that notice does not apply.

42.2

A supplier must include, in each discount recovery claim that it submits, the
following matters in respect of the period of supply to which the discount
recovery claim relates, and any other period of supply for which such matters
have not been included in a prior discount recovery claim—

42.2.a

in relation to any supply contract in respect of which Chapter 1, 2 or 4 of
Part 4 applies, details of each declaration submitted by the customer, and
each calculation or determination made by the supplier, under regulation
49(2), 54(3) or 63(2);

42.2.b

in relation to any supply contract in respect of which Chapter 3 of Part 4
applies, details of each notice given or received by the supplier under
regulation 58(1)(b)(ii) and confirmation that the requirements in regulation
58(1)(c) are being complied with.

##### Discount recovery rules

43

43.1

The Secretary of State must make rules about discount recovery.

43.2

43.3

Subject to paragraph (4), rules made under paragraph (1) must specify the
claim windows.

43.4

The rules may provide, in respect of claim windows starting after the end of
the second scheme period, that such windows, instead of being set out in the
rules, are to be determined and published by the Secretary of State at
intervals decided by the Secretary of State.

##### Claim windows

44

44.1

Regardless of whether claim windows are specified under regulation 43(3) or
published under regulation 43(4)—

44.1.a

the first claim window must start not more than 20 business days after the
scheme introduction date;

44.1.b

each claim window must have a duration of not less than 8 business days;

44.1.c

44.2

The dates of claim windows determined under regulation 43(4) must be published
at least 15 days in advance of each such claim window.

44.3

Where claim windows are published under regulation 43(4), after the Secretary
of State has determined and published the last reconciliation run-off date in
respect of any supplier, the Secretary of State need not determine and publish
any claim window that starts after that date.

##### Delegation of functions related to discount recovery

45

45.1

The Secretary of State may delegate to any person the performance of any of
the Secretary of State’s functions under the discount recovery rules.

45.2

Where, in performing those functions, the delegate is required to make or
receive any payment or give or receive any communication to or from suppliers,
the Secretary of State must publish a notice of the delegation identifying the
functions which the delegate is to perform.

45.3

A notice under paragraph (2) may specify that paragraph (4) applies in
relation to the delegate.

45.4

Where this paragraph applies, subject to any limitations or conditions in the
notice, and without prejudice to any provision of any contract between the
delegate and any person, the delegate is not liable in damages for anything
done or omitted to be done by it in the exercise or purported exercise of the
functions delegated to it.

### Adjustment of discount or supply quantity in certain cases

#### Arrangements in respect of customer’s financial exposure to wholesale price

      “ arrangement benefit ” has the meaning given in regulation 49(1)(a);
“ balancing services ” means a customer varying its consumption of energy in
order to provide a service—         to a person holding a transmission
licence, in connection with the balancing of flows of electricity onto and off
a transmission system, or           to a gas transporter, in connection with
the balancing of flows of gas into and out of a pipe-line system;
“ Chapter 1 arrangement ” means an arrangement of the kind described in
regulation 47(1)(b);           “ contract financial exposure ” has the meaning
given in regulation 47(1)(b);         a “declaration period” is the period

supply contract is—         the scheme introduction date, if on that date the
customer has made a Chapter 1 arrangement and is party to the supply contract;
in any other case, the date on which the customer—         enters into the
supply contract, having already made a Chapter 1 arrangement, or
makes a Chapter 1 arrangement, being already a party to the supply contract;
“periodic declaration dates” are dates chosen by the supplier, falling at
intervals of not more than 31 days, of which the first must be not more than
31 days after the initial declaration date and the last must be the last day
of the second scheme period.

##### Application of this Chapter

47

47.1

This Chapter applies in respect of a supply contract where—

47.1.a

it may reasonably be expected that—

47.1.a.i

the quantity of energy supplied to the customer at the premises to which the
supply contract relates in the 12-month period starting on 1st April 2023 will
exceed 0.5 gigawatt hours, or

47.1.a.ii

the maximum rate at which energy is supplied under the contract at any time
will exceed 0.5 megawatts, and

47.1.b

the customer has made arrangements, otherwise than in a supply contract, by
virtue of which the customer’s overall financial exposure to the wholesale
price of energy supplied to it in any period within a scheme period (the
“effective financial exposure”) differs from its financial exposure in that
period to the contracted wholesale price under the supply contract (the
“contract financial exposure”).

47.2

The ways in which a customer may make an arrangement of the kind described in
paragraph (1)(b) include entering into—

47.2.a

financial instruments in respect of the wholesale price of energy;

47.2.b

arrangements under which the customer obtains a benefit from the provision of
balancing services;

47.2.c

in connection with the electricity scheme, arrangements under which the
customer obtains a benefit by exporting electricity to an electricity system.

##### Customer declaration where this Chapter applies

48

48.1

A customer must, as soon as practicable and in any event within the period of
21 days beginning with the initial declaration date—

48.1.a

determine whether this Chapter applies in respect of a supply contract to
which it is party;

48.1.b

if it so determines, send to the supplier a declaration to that effect.

48.2

A supplier must in accordance with paragraph (3)—

48.2.a

determine whether either of the circumstances in regulation 47(1)(a) applies;

48.2.b

48.3.a

when it enters into a supply contract, or

48.3.b

in the case of a supply contract entered into before the scheme introduction
date, within the period of 45 days beginning with the scheme introduction
date.

##### Adjustment of discount

49

49.1

In respect of any period and supply contract in respect of which Chapter 1
arrangements apply—

49.1.a

subject to paragraph (d), the “arrangement benefit” is the amount calculated
as—

        CFE - EFE               Where—         CFE is the contract financial
exposure           EFE is the effective financial exposure;

49.1.b

the “ unit arrangement benefit ” (expressed in p/kWh) is the arrangement
benefit (expressed in pence) divided by the supply quantity in respect of that
period;

49.1.c

the reference wholesale price applicable to the supply contract in that period
is determined as—

        RWP' - UAB               Where—         RWP’ is the price that would
otherwise be determined (under regulation 9 or in accordance with regulation
10) as the reference wholesale price;           UAB is the unit arrangement
benefit;

49.1.d

in relation to a variable price contract, if the term {CFE – EFE} in paragraph
(a) is negative, the arrangement benefit in respect of that period is zero.

49.2

Where this Chapter applies in respect of a supply contract—

49.2.a

the supplier must, as soon as practicable after receiving the customer’s
declaration under regulation 48(1)(b), give notice to the customer of each
periodic declaration date and the declaration period for each such date;

49.2.b

the customer must, as soon as practicable and in any event within the period
of 14 days beginning with each periodic declaration date, determine and send
to the supplier a declaration of the amount of the arrangement benefit in
respect of the relevant declaration period, unless the arrangement benefit is
less than £100 per day of the declaration period;

49.2.c

the supplier must, on the basis of the arrangement benefit declared in each
such declaration—

49.2.c.i

calculate the unit arrangement benefit for the declaration period;

49.2.c.ii

calculate the reference wholesale price under paragraph (1)(c);

49.2.c.iii

calculate the base discount under regulation 28 on the basis of that wholesale
reference price;

49.2.c.iv

determine or redetermine its charges for energy supplied in the declaration
period on the basis of that discount.

49.3

Where this Chapter applies and the customer is party to more than one supply
contract, the effect of the Chapter 1 arrangements is to be determined in
respect of the supply contracts collectively and the arrangement benefit is to
be allocated between the supply contracts on an appropriate basis.

49.4

The contract parties may agree a basis on which—

49.4.a

an estimate of the arrangement benefit will be used in determining charges for
a billing period before the steps in paragraph (2) are completed, and

49.4.b

a subsequent reconciliation will be made when those steps are completed.

##### Rules in relation to this Chapter

50

50.1

the basis on which contract financial exposure or effective financial exposure
is to be determined;

50.2.c

the basis on which arrangement benefit is to be allocated between supply
contracts under regulation 49(3);

50.2.d

the form and content of any declaration to be made by the customer.

the scheme introduction date, if on that date the customer has made a Chapter
2 arrangement and is party to the supply contract;

51.1.c.ii

in any other case, the date on which the customer—

51.1.c.ii.aa

enters into the supply contract, having already made a Chapter 2 arrangement,
or

51.1.c.ii.bb

makes a Chapter 2 arrangement, being already a party to the supply contract;

51.1.d

“periodic declaration dates” are dates chosen by the supplier, falling at
intervals of not more than one month, of which the first must be not more than
31 days after the initial declaration date and the last must be the last day
of the second scheme period;

58

58.1

If in relation to a supply contract either the customer or the supplier is
party to an abusive arrangement—

58.1.a

the base discount and (in the case of an ETII supply contract) the increased
discount is to be reduced by such amount as will ensure that the benefit of
the scheme is not increased by that arrangement;

58.1.b

the party specified in paragraph (2) must promptly and as frequently as is
required to give effect to this regulation—

58.1.b.i

determine the reduction in the discount required under sub-paragraph (a);

58.1.b.ii

give notice of that reduction to the other contract party;

58.1.c

the supplier must—

58.1.c.i

reduce the base discount and (in the case of an ETII supply contract) the
increased discount by the amount determined under sub-paragraph (a);

58.1.c.ii

determine or redetermine its charges for energy supplied accordingly.

58.2

The party is—

58.2.a

the supplier, if it is party to the abusive arrangement;

58.2.b

otherwise, the customer.

##### Rules in relation to this Chapter

59

The Secretary of State may make rules about—

59.a

the kinds of arrangements which are or are not, or factors which indicate
whether arrangements are or are not, abusive arrangements;

59.b

the determination of the amount by which the benefit of the scheme is
increased by an abusive arrangement;

59.c

how the discount is to be reduced to ensure such increase is not achieved.

#### Declarations to be made where customer is making energy available to end users outside Northern Ireland

##### Interpretation of this Chapter

60

For the purposes of this Chapter—

60.a

a “declaration period” is the period between any periodic declaration date and
any subsequent periodic declaration date;

60.b

the “initial declaration date” in respect of a supply contract is the later
of—

60.b.i

the scheme introduction date, and

60.b.ii

the date on which the relevant arrangements are put in place;

60.c

“periodic declaration dates” are dates chosen by the supplier, falling at
intervals of not more than one month, of which the first shall be not more
than 31 days after the initial declaration date and the last shall be the last
day of the second scheme period;

60.d

“ relevant arrangement ” has the meaning given in regulation 61(3).

##### Application of this Chapter

61

61.1

This Chapter applies in respect of a supply contract, subject to paragraph
(2), where —

61.1.a

it may reasonably be expected that—

61.1.a.i

the quantity of energy supplied to the customer at the premises to which the
supply contract relates in the 12-month period starting on 1st April 2023 will
exceed 0.5 gigawatt hours, or

61.1.a.ii

the maximum rate at which energy is suppled under the contract at any time
will exceed 0.5 megawatts, and

61.1.b

arrangements are in place under which—

61.1.b.i

energy supplied to the customer under the supply contract may be made
available to an end user at premises located outside Northern Ireland, or

61.1.b.ii

heating, cooling, hot water or electricity may be made available, using energy
supplied under the supply contract, to an end user at premises located outside
Northern Ireland.

61.2

This chapter does not apply where—

61.2.a

the quantities in which or rates at which—

61.2.a.i

energy (as provided in paragraph (1)(b)(i)), and

61.2.a.ii

heating, cooling, hot water or electricity (as provided in paragraph
(1)(b)(ii)) may be made available to end users outside Northern Ireland are
not material, and

61.2.b

the application of this Chapter would be disproportionate, having regard to
the complexity of determining non-qualifying quantities and to the quantities
and rates referred to in sub-paragraph (a).

61.3

Any arrangement of the kind described in paragraph (1)(b) is a “ relevant
arrangement ” for the purposes of this Chapter.

##### Customer declaration where this Chapter applies

62

62.1

A customer must, as soon as practicable and in any event within 21 days after
the initial declaration date—

62.1.a

determine whether this Chapter applies in respect of a supply contract to
which it is party, and

62.1.b

if it so determines, send to the supplier a declaration to that effect.

62.2

A supplier must, when it enters into a supply contract, or for a supply
contract which it has entered into before the scheme introduction date, within
45 days after the scheme introduction date—

62.2.a

determine whether either of the circumstances in regulation 61(1)(a) applies,

62.2.b

if either circumstance applies, give the customer notice of that
determination, and

62.2.c

draw this Chapter to the attention of the customer, unless the customer has
already sent a declaration under paragraph (1)(b).

##### Determination of non-qualifying quantity

63

63.1

Where this Chapter applies in respect of a supply contract, that part of the
quantity of electricity or gas supplied (in any period)—

63.1.a

which was made available to end users at premises located outside Northern
Ireland, or

63.1.b

which was used to make available heating, cooling, hot water or electricity to
end users at premises located outside Northern Ireland,

is a “ non-qualifying quantity ” for the purposes of the scheme.

63.2

Where this Chapter applies in respect of a supply contract—

63.2.a

the supplier must as soon as practicable after receiving the customer’s
declaration under regulation 62(1)(b) give notice to the customer of each
periodic declaration date and (for each such date) the declaration period;

63.2.b

the customer must, as soon as practicable and in any event within 14 days
after each periodic declaration date, determine and send to the supplier a
declaration of the quantity of electricity or gas supplied in the relevant
declaration period which is a non-qualifying quantity;

63.2.c

the supplier must on the basis of the non-qualifying quantity declared in each
such declaration—

63.2.c.i

determine the amount of the supply quantity for the declaration period to
which the discounted supply price is to apply;

63.2.c.ii

determine or redetermine its charges for energy supplied in the declaration
period accordingly.

63.3

The contract parties may agree a basis on which an estimate of the non-
qualifying quantity will be used in determining charges for a billing period
before (and with a subsequent reconciliation when) the steps in paragraph (2)
are completed.

##### Rules in relation to this Chapter

64

The Secretary of State may make rules about—

64.a

the basis on which it is to be determined what part of the quantity of gas or
electricity supplied is a non-qualifying quantity;

64.b

the circumstances in which, by virtue of regulation 61(2), this Chapter does
not apply;

64.c

the form and content of a declaration to be made by the customer

### Further provisions

#### Duties of suppliers in connection with the scheme

##### Increases in charges and other changes in relation to supply contracts

65

65.1

increase the rates at which it charges any amounts payable by the customer
under the supply contract,

65.1.b

expose a customer to any additional risk, or

doing any of the things referred to in paragraph (1)(a) to (c)—

65.2.a

a supplier’s conduct is, in particular, unreasonable if, and to the extent
that, the conduct, or the supplier’s ability to retain the customer as a
customer while engaging in it, is facilitated by the existence or operation of
the scheme;

65.2.b

it is, in particular, reasonable for a supplier to increase its charges—

65.2.b.i

to its customers collectively, by an amount that in aggregate does not exceed
the efficiently incurred costs of complying with these Regulations;

65.2.b.ii

to any customer, by an amount that does not exceed its fair and reasonable
share of such efficiently incurred costs.

#### Deemed terms of supply contracts

##### Deemed terms of supply contracts

66

66.1

Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), terms to the following effect are implied
into a supply contract—

66.1.a

that in respect of energy supplied under the contract during a scheme period,
the supply price is reduced by the discount as required under Part 2 and Part
4;

66.1.b

that where the application of the Regulations changes the discount or a
quantity of energy to which the discount applies, the rights and obligations
of the supplier and customer in respect of payment for energy supplied are
determined, or as necessary redetermined, so as to reflect such change in
discount or quantity;

66.1.c

that no term of the contract, and no act or omission on the part of the
customer, is to be construed as entitling the supplier to require the
customer—

66.1.c.i

to pay a greater amount than the supplier would have been entitled to require
it to pay if acting in accordance with the Regulations, or

66.1.c.ii

to be otherwise subject to terms that it would not have been lawful under the
Regulations for the supplier to have included in a supply contract,

in respect of any energy supplied by the supplier in a scheme period;

66.1.d

that nothing done by the supplier or the customer in order to comply with
these Regulations or rules made under them, or in following guidance issued by
the Secretary of State in relation to the scheme, is a breach of any provision
of the contract;

66.1.e

that the coming into force of the Act, the making of these Regulations or
rules under them, and the issuing of guidance by the Secretary of State in
relation to the scheme, do not constitute—

66.1.e.i

a change in the law for the purposes of any provision (however expressed) of
the contract which permits the supplier to increase its prices or charges or
take any other action in consequence of a change in the law;

66.1.e.ii

an event or circumstance which under any provision of the contract (however
expressed) excuses the supplier or the customer from performance of its
obligations, or from liability for failure to perform its obligations, under
the contract.

changes include a change applying in respect of energy already supplied to the
customer;

66.2.c

rights and obligations include rights and obligations for adjustment of
charges already made or paid.

contract for which an opt-out notice has been given under regulation 4(3), and
has not been withdrawn, under regulation 4(4).

66.4

None of the terms listed in paragraph (1) is to be construed as preventing a
supplier from increasing its charges to a customer in order to recover the
costs of complying with Parts 2 and 3 if and to the extent it is permitted to
do so under the terms of—

66.4.a

its supply contract,

66.4.b

## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations, which apply in Northern Ireland, establish the Energy
Bills Discount Scheme for Non-Domestic Customers in Northern Ireland (“ EBDS
”). EBDS is a scheme for reducing the costs, to non-domestic customers, of
being supplied with electricity or gas (“energy”) by a supplier that holds a
supply licence under the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992   or Gas
(Northern Ireland) Order 1996 .

  The Regulations require suppliers to reduce, in accordance with Part 2 of
the Regulations, the prices that they charge customers for energy during two “
scheme periods ” (the first running from 1st April 2023 to 30th September 2023
and the second from 1st October 2023 to 31st March 2024). Suppliers are
entitled to recover the amount of these reductions from the Secretary of
State.

  Part 1 (introductory) defines key terms and parameters of EBDS. With certain
exceptions, EBDS applies in respect of all contracts for the supply of energy
by licensed suppliers to non-domestic customers during the scheme periods.
However, the detail of its application to any given contract (including how
discounts are calculated) depends on how prices are set under it, and, in some
cases, on the use that is made of the energy supplied under it.

  Part 2 (discounted supply price) sets out how the discounts that are to be
applied by suppliers are to be calculated, based on wholesale energy prices.
Chapter 1 of Part 2 sets out how the figures to be used in calculating
discounts are derived. Chapter 2 of Part 2 describes how suppliers must assign
each contract to the correct category based on how prices are set under it.
Chapter 3 of Part 2 sets out the procedures for identifying where the energy
supplied under a contract is used in certain ways, either by persons carrying
out particular economic activities, or in heat networks that meet certain
criteria. Where this is the case, the customers under the contracts concerned
are known as “ETII” and “QHS” customers respectively. Chapter 4 of Part 2
describes how suppliers must calculate discounts for the different categories
of contract and customer, reduce their charges to customers accordingly, and
provide them with related information.

  Part 3 (discount recovery) deals with the process by which each supplier is
entitled to be paid by the Secretary of State an amount equal to the charges
it has foregone in applying discounts under Part 2. In specified
circumstances, the amount that a supplier receives in response to its claim
for payment of an amount in respect of discounts is adjusted. Where such
adjustments result in a negative sum, the customer must pay that sum (as a
positive amount) to the Secretary of State. Amounts claimed by suppliers may
be withheld in certain cases, for example where a supplier has acted
dishonestly or failed to take proper measures to prevent fraud.

  Part 4 (adjustment of discount or supply quantity in certain cases) makes
provision to prevent suppliers or customers from deriving greater benefit from
EBDS than is intended in certain scenarios. The Regulations provide for the
benefits that customers and suppliers receive from the scheme to be reduced to
take account of their entry into specified kinds of arrangements.

  Part 5 (further provisions) deals with a number of different matters.
Regulation 65 prohibits unreasonable increases in suppliers’ charges and other
changes adverse to the customer. Regulation 66 implies terms relating to the
scheme into non-domestic supply contracts. Regulations 67 to 71 impose
information and reporting obligations. Regulations 72 to 76 make provision
about the resolution of disputes arising from the operation of the scheme.
Regulation 77 provides that specified obligations of suppliers under the
regulations are enforceable by the Northern Ireland Regulator. Regulations 79
and 80 provide for the Secretary of State to impose civil penalties on those
who fail to comply with certain provisions of Part 3 or Part 4. Regulation 82
provides that things done under certain provisions of the Energy Bill Relief
Scheme (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2022 are to be treated as if done under
corresponding provisions of the Regulations. Regulation 83 makes an amendment
to regulation 34 of the Energy Bill Relief Scheme Regulations 2022 .

  A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the
costs of business and the voluntary sector is available from the Department
for Energy Security and Net Zero at 1 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0ET and is
published with the Explanatory Memorandum alongside the instrument on
