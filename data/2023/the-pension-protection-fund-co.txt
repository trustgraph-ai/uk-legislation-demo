## EXPLANATORY NOTE

  (This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend the Pension Protection Fund (Compensation) Regulations
(Northern Ireland) 2005 and the Occupational Pension Schemes (Fraud
Compensation Payments and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations (Northern
Ireland) 2005.

Regulation 2 amends the Pension Protection Fund (Compensation) Regulations
(Northern Ireland) 2005 to remove the requirement for a dependent child
survivor to commence a qualifying course within one year of leaving the
previous course. It allows dependent children to continue to receive
compensation payments if they begin the new qualifying course before reaching
the age of 23.

Regulation 3 amends the Occupational Pension Schemes (Fraud Compensation
Payments and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 to
include an additional specific liability incurred by the trustees of a scheme
when they make an application for compensation from the Fraud Compensation
Fund.

As these Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision
corresponding to provision contained in regulations made by the Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain, the requirement to
consult under Article 289(1) of the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 2005
does not apply by virtue of paragraph (2)(e) of that Article.
