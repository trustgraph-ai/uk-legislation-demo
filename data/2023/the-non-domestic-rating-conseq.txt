## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations make amendments which are consequential on the Non-
Domestic Rating Act  2023 (c. 53)  (the “ 2023 Act ”). As part of the changes
introduced by it, the 2023 Act repeals and re-enacts provisions of the Local
Government Finance Act  1988 (c. 41)  (the “ 1988 Act ”). Regulations 2, 5,
7(a) and (c), 8, 9 and 11 to 14 of these Regulations amend several non-
domestic rating instruments to update the references to the amended provisions
of the 1988 Act. Regulation 15 makes a saving provision relating to the
amendments to the Non-Domestic Rating (Chargeable Amounts) (England)
Regulations 2022 ( S.I. 2022/1403 ).

  Regulations 3, 4 and 6 update other out of date statutory references
contained within non-domestic rating instruments. These are unrelated to the
2023 Act.

  Regulation 7(b) revokes a spent provision.

  Regulation 10 prescribes a class of hereditaments for the purposes of
central list unoccupied hereditaments rate relief, which is introduced by the
2023 Act. The prescribed class reflects the class of local list hereditaments
which are not subject to a non-domestic rate when unoccupied.

  Regulation 16 revokes the Non-Domestic Rating (Discretionary Relief)
Regulations 1989 ( S.I. 1989/1050 ) to remove constraints on the powers for
local authorities in England to award discretionary relief.

  An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument because it
amends an existing local tax regime. Publication of a full impact assessment
is not necessary for such legislation.
