## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations make amendments to the Accounting Standards (Prescribed
Bodies) (United States of America and Japan) Regulations 2015 (“ the 2015
Regulations ”).

  Regulation 3 amends regulation 1 of the 2015 Regulations in order to remove
the expiry provisions.

  Regulation 4 inserts new regulation 5A which directs a UK incorporated
parent company preparing group accounts to the standards of a body prescribed
under regulation 2 of the 2015 Regulations to insert a note into the accounts.
The required disclosure is the date of the company’s incorporation and the
number of financial years remaining for which the company may prepare accounts
under regulation 5 of the 2015 Regulations. After four financial years the
company, if it has not already done so, must prepare group accounts to UK GAAP
(Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) or UK International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).

  Regulation 5 substitutes regulation 8 of the 2015 Regulations to provide at
new regulation 8(1) an obligation on the Secretary of State to complete
periodic reviews of the 2015 Regulations, set out the conclusions of the
review in a report and publish the report in accordance with regulation 8(2).

  The new regulation 8(3) and (4) stipulate the date by which the report under
the amended 2015 Regulations must be published and that following that date
the Secretary of State must periodically review the 2015 Regulations and
publish a report at least every five years.

  Regulation 6 removes regulation 9 of the 2015 Regulations the requirements
of which have been incorporated into the new regulation 8.

  The Regulations extend to the whole of the United Kingdom, reflecting the
extent of the Companies Act 2006.

  A full impact assessment of the effect that the 2015 Regulations will have
on the costs of business is annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum of the 2015
Regulations. This is available from the Department for Business and Trade, Old
Admiralty Building. London, SW1A 2DY and is published alongside the 2015
Regulations at  www.legislation.gov.uk .

  A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or
no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
