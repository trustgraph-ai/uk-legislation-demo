received hospital treatment or ambulance services. The charges are specified
in certificates issued by the Department for Communities and are payable by
persons who pay compensation to the injured person. The charges in each case
are calculated by reference to a tariff of charges provided for by the

charges in respect of injuries which occur on or after 1st April 2023. Where
the injured person is provided with health care ambulance services, the charge
is increased from £231 to £238 for each occasion. Where the injured person
receives health care treatment but is not admitted to hospital the charge is
