## EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend section 10(2) of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act
2000 (c. 37)  (“ the Act ”) in relation to Wales.

Section 10(2) of the Act prescribes the time periods within which the Natural
Resources Body for Wales (as the appropriate countryside body in relation to
Wales) must conduct initial and subsequent reviews of maps issued by it in
conclusive form under section 9 of the Act, showing registered common land and
open country in Wales.

These Regulations amend section 10(2)(b)(ii) of the Act in order to extend the
maximum interval between subsequent reviews following a first review, from 10
years after the previous review, to 15 years.

The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact
Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it
was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to
the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.
