## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations further amend the Health and Personal Social Services
(Optical Charges and Payments) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1997 (“ the
principal Regulations ”) which provide for payment to be made, by means of a
voucher system, in respect of costs incurred by certain categories of persons
in connection with the supply, replacement and repair of optical appliances.

  Regulation 2 amends regulation 19 of the principal Regulations to increase
the redemption value of a voucher issued towards the cost of replacement of a
single contact lens and to increase the maximum contribution by way of a
voucher to the cost of repair of a frame.

  Regulation 3 and the Schedule amend Schedules 1, 2 and 3 to the principal
Regulations. Firstly, the value of vouchers issued towards the costs of supply
and replacement of glasses and contact lenses and of vouchers for glasses
where the frame needs to be specially manufactured is increased; secondly, the
additional values for vouchers for prisms, tints, photochromic lenses and
special categories of appliances are increased; and thirdly, the value of
vouchers issued towards the cost of repair and replacement of optical
appliances is increased.

  Regulation 4 provides that the increases contained in regulation 2 and 3
apply only in relation to vouchers accepted or used on or after 1st July 2024.
