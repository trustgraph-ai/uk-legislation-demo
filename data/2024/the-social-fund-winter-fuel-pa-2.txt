## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations amend the Social Fund Winter Fuel Payment Regulations
(Northern Ireland) 2024 ( S.R. 2024 No. 160 ) (“ the 2024 Regulations ”) to
correct minor errors in those Regulations.

  Regulation 2(4) of the 2024 Regulations provides that the Department must
pay a Winter Fuel Payment to anyone who has reached State Pension age by the
end of qualifying week, is resident in Northern Ireland and in receipt of
Pension Credit or other qualifying benefit. Regulation 2(4) of the 2024
Regulations is amended to correct a mistake in the definition of ‘pensionable
age’.

  Regulation 5(2) of the 2024 Regulations makes provision that allows the
Department to pay a winter fuel payment to a person who appears to be entitled
to a payment under regulation 2 of the 2024 Regulations. Regulation 5(2) of
the 2024 Regulations is amended to insert reference to the Social Security
Commissioners, which had been erroneously omitted from the 2024 Regulations.

  These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision
corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by
virtue of section 150(1)(a) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social
Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992, are not subject to the
requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social
Security Advisory Committee.
