## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations amend regulation 97 of the Universal Credit Regulations
(Northern Ireland) 2016 ( S.R. 2016 No. 216 ), which sets out the
circumstances in which work search and work availability requirements must not
be imposed on a universal credit claimant. Regulation 2 amends paragraph (14)
of regulation 97 so that work search and work availability requirements must
not be imposed where a claimant has monthly earnings from employment that are
equal to, or more than, 18 hours per week at the national minimum wage as set
out in regulation 4 of the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 (“the
national living wage rate”) or, where the claimant is a member of a couple,
their combined earnings from employment are equal to, or more than, 29 hours
per week at the national living wage rate, in both cases converted to a
monthly amount by multiplying by 52 and dividing by 12.

  These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision
corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by
virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social
Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act  1992 (c.8)  are not subject to
the requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the
Social Security Advisory Committee.

  A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no,
or no significant impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is
foreseen.
