## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Order)

  Section 355 of the Proceeds of Crime Act (c.29) (“ POCA ”) allows the
Department of Justice to make an Order which applies articles 17, 18 23 and 24
of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 ( S.I. 1989
No. 1341 (N.I. 12) ) (“ PACE ”) with modifications, in relation to search and
seizure warrants obtained in the course of certain categories of investigation
in Part 8 of POCA.

  The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act  2023 (c.56)  inserted new
Chapters 3C to 3F into Part 5 of POCA, which contain new powers in relation to
the forfeiture of certain cryptoassets which are derived from, or are intended
for use in, unlawful conduct. These largely align with existing forfeiture
powers in relation to cash, certain listed items of personal property, and
funds in bank or building society accounts. The new powers are supported by a
new type of investigation in Part 8 Of POCA.

  This Order amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Application of Police and
Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989) Order (Northern Ireland) 2016
( S.R. 2016 No. 33 .) so that articles 17, 18, 23 and 24 of PACE, and the
modifications to those articles made by that Order, will apply to the new type
of investigation.

  An impact assessment has not been produced for this Order as no impact is
foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sectors.
