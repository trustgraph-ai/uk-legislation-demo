## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations omit certain provisions in regulations 2 and 4, and
regulation 5 of the Non-Domestic Rating Act 2023 (Consequential Amendments to
Secondary Legislation) (Wales) Regulations 2023 (“ the 2023 Regulations ”) and
make amendments to various statutory instruments.

  Regulations 2, 4 and 5 of the 2023 Regulations make changes to certain
secondary legislation in relation to Wales in consequence to the Non-Domestic
Rating Act 2023 (“ the 2023 Act ”). Sections 1 and 2 of the 2023 Act repeal
certain provisions in Part 3 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 (“ the
1988 Act ”) and re-enact those provisions in new Schedules 4ZA and 4ZB to the
1988 Act.

  Regulations 2, 4 and 5 of the 2023 Regulations came into force on 27 October
2023 but did not expressly state that they took effect from 1 April 2024, in
line with when the relevant changes in the 2023 Act also take effect.

  Part 2 of these Regulations omits certain provisions in regulations 2 and 4,
and regulation 5 of the 2023 Regulations and restates provisions of the
following statutory instruments in relation to Wales (“the Secondary
Legislation”) as they applied immediately before regulations 2, 4 and 5 came
into force:         the Non-Domestic Rating (Collection and Enforcement)
(Local Lists) Regulations 1989;           the Non-Domestic Rating (Demand
Notices) (Wales) Regulations 2017;           the Non-Domestic Rating (Small
Business Relief) (Wales) Order 2017.

  Part 3 of these Regulations makes consequential changes to the Secondary
Legislation and the Non-Domestic Rating (Collection and Enforcement)
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 1990 (“ the 1990 Regulations ”) to
reflect the re-enacted provisions in Schedules 4ZA and 4ZB to the 1988 Act. In
the case of the 1990 Regulations, references to sections 45(6) and 47(2)(a) of
the 1988 Act are omitted as these provisions have been repealed by earlier
Acts.

  The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory
Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a
result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact
assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this
instrument.
