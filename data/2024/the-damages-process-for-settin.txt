Title: The Damages (Process for Setting Rate of Return) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2024
Date: 2024-07-02
Description: These Regulations alter some of the parameters which are to be used by the official rate-assessor (the Government Actuary) in setting the rate of return for the purposes of section C1(1) of the Damages Act 1996. That rate is known as the Personal Injury Discount Rate and is used in the calculation of awards of damages for future pecuniary loss in an action for personal injury. Under Schedule C1 to the 1996 Act, the rate is to be set to reflect the return which a hypothetical claimant investor (as described in paragraph 17 of that Schedule) could reasonably be expected to achieve if investing in the notional portfolio over the prescribed period, subject to two standard adjustments.

## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations alter some of the parameters which are to be used by the
official rate-assessor (the Government Actuary) in setting the rate of return
for the purposes of section C1(1) of the Damages Act 1996. That rate is known
as the Personal Injury Discount Rate and is used in the calculation of awards
of damages for future pecuniary loss in an action for personal injury. Under
Schedule C1 to the 1996 Act, the rate is to be set to reflect the return which
a hypothetical claimant investor (as described in paragraph 17 of that
Schedule) could reasonably be expected to achieve if investing in the notional
portfolio over the prescribed period, subject to two standard adjustments.

  Regulation 2 increases (from 0.75 to 1.25) the number of percentage points
which are, as a standard adjustment, to be deducted to represent the impact of
taxation and the costs of investment advice and management.

  Regulation 3 changes the basis upon which the rate-assessor is to make
allowance for the impact of inflation. It prescribes published information to
be used instead of the retail prices index. The information is known as “
Average Weekly Earnings ” and is used to measure changes in earnings over
time. “Average Weekly Earnings” is a series of statistics designated by the
Statistics Board as “ National Statistics ” (in accordance with section 12 of
the Statistics and Registration Service Act  2007 (c.18) ) and published by
the Statistics Board (operating through the Office of National Statistics
(ONS)) in a monthly statistical bulletin entitled “Average weekly earnings in
Great Britain”, which is available on the ONS website ( www.ons.gov.uk ). It
is based on information from wages and salaries from businesses in Great
Britain, obtained through the Monthly Wages and Salaries Survey conducted by
ONS.
