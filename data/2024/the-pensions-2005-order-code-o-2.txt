## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This is not part of the Order)

  This Order appoints the day for the purposes of Article 86(7) of the
Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 for the coming into operation of the
Pensions Regulator General code of practice as 5th July 2024. The General code
of practice consolidates ten existing codes of practice and provides guidance
to those running occupational, personal, and public service pension schemes.

  The General code of practice is available on the Pensions Regulator’s
website:  https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/document-library . Copies
may be obtained by post from the Pensions Regulator, Telecom House, 125-135

  Article 3 of this Order amends Article 2 of the Pensions (2005 Order)
(Commencement No. 3, Appointed Day, Transitional Provisions and Amendment)
Order (Northern Ireland) 2005 by omitting paragraph (1) of that Article, which
brought into effect the Pensions Regulator Code of Practice No. 1: Reporting
breaches of the law. That code of practice is revoked with effect from 5th
July 2024, under the Pensions (2005 Order) (Codes of Practice) (Revocation)
Order (Northern Ireland) 2024 ( S.R. 2024 No. 131 ) (“ the 2024 Revocation
Order ”).

  Article 4 of the Order revokes the eight Appointed Day Orders which brought
into effect a number of other codes of practice issued by the Pensions
Regulator, which have also been revoked by the 2024 Revocation Order.
