## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Order)

  Section 18(3) of, and Part 3 of Schedule 13 to, the Coronavirus Act 2020
contain provisions relating to the registration of deaths and still-births in
Northern Ireland.

  Section 89(1) provides for the Act to expire at the end of the period of 2
years beginning with the day on which it was passed (25th March 2020). This is
subject to limited exceptions. Section 90 allows expiring provisions to be
extended for not more than 6 months from the date on which they would
otherwise expire (whether by virtue of section 89 or previous Orders made
under section 90).

  The Coronavirus Act 2020 (Registration of Deaths and Still-Births)
(Extension) (No.2) Order (Northern Ireland) 2023 ( S.R. 2023 No. 137 )
extended the expiry date of the following provisions of the Coronavirus Act
2020 to 24 th  March 2024 – (a) paragraphs 18 to 22 and 27 to 29 of Schedule
13; (b) paragraph 17 of that Schedule so far as it relates to those
paragraphs; (c) section 18(3) so far as it relates to the provisions mentioned
in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this article, but that Order has not been
approved by the Assembly.

  The Department, however, wishes to ensure that these provisions are extended
to 24 th  March 2024 so makes this Order. The making of this Order renders the
continued operation of  S.R. 2023 No. 137  unnecessary and so that Order is
revoked by this Order.
