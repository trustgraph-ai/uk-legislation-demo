## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  This Order amends the Misuse of Drugs (Designation) Order (Northern Ireland)
2001 ( S.R. 2001 No. 431 ) (“ the Order ”).

  Regulation 2 adds twenty-one substances (including seventeen synthetic
opioids, sixteen of which are nitazenes) to Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Order.
Section 7(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act  1971 (c. 38)  requires the Department
of Health to make regulations to allow drugs controlled under that Act to be
used for medicinal purposes. Section 7(3), however, does not apply to any drug
which is designated by order under section 7(4) of that Act. Controlled drugs
are designated where the Department of Health is of the opinion that it is in
the public interest for production, supply and possession of that drug to be
either wholly unlawful or unlawful except for research or other special
purposes, or for medicinal use of the drug to be unlawful except under
licence. Schedule 1 to the Order specifies the list of controlled drugs to
which section 7(4) applies.
