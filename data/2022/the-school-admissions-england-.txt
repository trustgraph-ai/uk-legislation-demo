## EXPLANATORY NOTE

  (This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend the School Admissions (England) (Coronavirus) (Appeals
Arrangements) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (“ the 2020 Regulations ”).

The 2020 Regulations amended the School Admissions (Appeals Arrangements)
(England) Regulations 2012 (“ the 2012 Regulations ”) for a temporary period.
Where it was not reasonably practicable for certain existing constitutional
and procedural requirements relating to school admissions appeals to be
complied with for a reason related to the incidence or transmission of
coronavirus, other more flexible constitutional and procedural requirements
were made available.

Regulation 2(a) of the 2020 Regulations states that those Regulations apply to
appeals to which the 2012 Regulations apply and which are lodged: on or after
24th April 2020 but on or before 30th September 2022; and before 24th April
2020 but where the appeal has not been fully determined on or before that
date. However, Regulation 3(2) of the 2020 Regulations states that regulations
6 to 11 of those Regulations cease to have effect on 30th September 2022.

Regulation 2 amends regulation 3(2) of the 2020 Regulations so that
regulations 6 to 11 cease to have effect at the end of 30th September 2022
rather than at the beginning of that date. This brings the expiry of the 2020
Regulations into line with regulation 2(a) of those Regulations, which makes
provision for the 2020 Regulations to apply to appeals lodged on 30th
September 2022. Accordingly, these Regulations are being issued free of charge
to all known recipients of the School Admissions (England) (Coronavirus)
(Appeals Arrangements) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2021 which last amended
the expiry date in regulation 3(2) of the 2020 Regulations.

A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or
no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
