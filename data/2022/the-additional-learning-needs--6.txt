## EXPLANATORY NOTE

  This Order brings into force provisions of the Additional Learning Needs and

  The Act establishes a statutory framework for supporting children and young
people with additional learning needs. This replaces the legislation
surrounding special educational needs and the assessment of children and young

responsibility for securing educational provision for those with additional
learning needs who are over compulsory school age from the Welsh Ministers to
the relevant local authority.

  The provisions listed in article 2 come into force on 1 September 2025 in
relation to those who are over compulsory school age on 1 September 2022.

  Sections 40 to 44 of the Act (additional learning provision for detained
persons) come into force on 1 September 2022 for those who are over compulsory
school age on 1 September 2022 (article 3).

  The provisions listed in paragraphs (a) to (o) of article 2 come into force
on 1 September 2022 for persons in relation to whom an individual development
plan is being prepared or kept under section 40 or 42 of the Act, or prepared
or maintained under section 14 of the Act as a result of regulation 23 of the
Additional Learning Needs (Wales) Regulations 2021 (article 4).
