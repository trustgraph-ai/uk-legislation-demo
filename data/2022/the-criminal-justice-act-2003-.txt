## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations bring into force on 2nd May 2022 provisions in the
Criminal Justice Act  2003 (c. 44)  (“ the 2003 Act ”) and the Sentencing Act
2020 (c. 17)  (“ the 2020 Act ”).

  Regulation 3(a) brings into force section 282 of the 2003 Act (increase in
maximum term that may be imposed on summary conviction of offence triable
either way). Section 282(1) amends section 32 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act
1980 (c. 43)  (“ the 1980 Act ”) (penalties on summary conviction for offences
triable either way) to increase the maximum penalty that a magistrates’ court
can impose on summary conviction of an offence listed in Schedule 1 to the
1980 Act, from 6 months’ imprisonment to 12 months’. Section 282(2) and (3)
together increase the maximum term of imprisonment to which a person is liable
on summary conviction of an offence that is triable either way in the
following circumstances: the offence is set out in legislation made before or
during the same session as the 2003 Act, is punishable with imprisonment on
summary conviction, and is not listed in Schedule 1 to the 1980 Act. Section
282(4) provides that only offences committed after the provision is commenced
are affected. The maximum penalty is increased from 6 months’ imprisonment to
12 months’.

  Regulation 3(b)(i) brings into force section 283(1)(b) and (3) of the 2003
Act (enabling powers: power to alter maximum penalties). Section 283(1)(b)
confers a power on the Secretary of State to amend any enactment made before
or in the same session as the 2003 Act, so as to make a person liable on
summary conviction to a term of imprisonment as regards an offence triable
either way. Section 283(3) provides that an order made under section 283(1)(b)
may amend the enactment in question to increase the maximum penalty on summary
conviction of an offence created under the power, to 12 months’ imprisonment.

  Regulation 3(b)(ii) brings into force sections 283(4) and (7) insofar as
they relate to paragraphs 6 and 7 of Schedule 27 to the 2003 Act (enabling
powers: alteration of maximum penalties etc.). These provisions amend powers
in the Environmental Protection Act  1990 (c. 43)  and the Scotland Act  1998
(c. 46)  to create offences to ensure they may provide for a maximum sentence
of 12 months’ imprisonment on summary conviction of a triable either way
offence.

  Regulation 4 brings into force paragraph 24 of Schedule 22 to the 2020 Act
(amendments of the Sentencing Code and related amendments of other
legislation) for offences triable either way only. Paragraph 24 amends section
224 of the 2020 Act to increase the maximum penalty that a magistrates’ court
can give on summary conviction of an offence triable either way from 6 months’
imprisonment to 12 months’.

  Regulation 5 and the Schedule replace existing legislative references to the
commencement of paragraph 24 of Schedule 22 to the 2020 Act and sections 154
and 282 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 with the actual date of commencement
(2nd May 2022). These replacements are made using the power in section
104(1)(a) of the Deregulation Act 2015 and spell out one of the effects of the
amendments brought into force by regulations 3 and 4.

  Regulation 6 amends section 224 of the 2020 Act to make clear on the face of
that provision the effect of the amendment brought into force by regulation 4,
namely the partial commencement of paragraph 24 of Schedule 22 to the 2020
Act. The amendments are made using the powers at section 419(1) and (2) of the
2020 Act. Regulation 6 comes into force one minute after the provisions
commenced by regulation 4.

  Regulation 7 inserts a new subsection into section 141 of the Environmental
Protection Act 1990 to make transitional provision to ensure that where
Regulations under the power conferred by that section make provision for a
summary offence to be punishable with imprisonment for more than 6 months,
those Regulations must also provide in relation to any offence committed
before the day on which section 281(5) of the 2003 Act comes into force, any
reference to a sentence of imprisonment of more than six months is to be read
as six months.

  Regulation 8 makes a comparable amendment to section 113 of the Scotland Act
1998.

  A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the
costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available
from the Ministry of Justice, 102 Petty France, London, SW1H 9AJ and is
published alongside the instrument on  www.legislation.gov.uk
