## EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations are made in response to the ongoing danger to public health
which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wales. Section 45B of the Public Health
(Control of Disease) Act 1984 enables the Welsh Ministers, by regulations, to
make provision for the purpose of (amongst other things) preventing danger to
public health from “vessels, aircraft, trains or other conveyances arriving at
any place”.

The Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Public Health
Information for Persons Travelling to Wales etc.) Regulations 2020 ( S.I.
2020/595 (W. 136) ) (“ the Public Health Information Regulations ”) and the
Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel, Pre-Departure Testing
and Operator Liability) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 ( S.I. 2021/48
(W. 11) ) (“ the Operator Liability Regulations ”).

The Public Health Information Regulations and the Operator Liability
Regulations impose requirements on persons operating international passenger
services arriving into Wales from outside the common travel area
(“operators”).

In consequence of the revocation and replacement of the Health Protection
(Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 ( S.I. 2020/574
(W. 132)  by the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales)
Regulations 2022 ( S.I. 2022/126 (W. 41) ), these Regulations make amendments
to the Public Health Information Regulations and Operator Liability
Regulations.

The Public Health Information Regulations are also amended to provide that
operators need only provide specified information to passengers pre-departure
and on-board an international passenger service. The Schedule is amended to
update the information that must be provided to passengers.

In addition, the Operator Liability Regulations are amended to replace the
current suite of obligations on operators with an obligation to maintain
adequate processes and systems to ensure that passengers possess certain
information or evidence. Operators are also required to retain such records
and information as are required to show that they have maintained adequate
systems and processes. Amendments are also made to ensure that a fixed penalty
notice can be issued in respect of an ongoing breach of the new duty where a
previous fixed penalty notice issued in respect of the breach has been paid.

There has been no regulatory impact assessment in relation to these
Regulations due to the need to put them in place urgently to deal with a
serious and imminent threat to public health.
