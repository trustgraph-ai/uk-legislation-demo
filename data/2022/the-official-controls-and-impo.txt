## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations amend the Official Controls (Extension of Transitional
Periods) Regulations 2021 (“ the 2021 Regulations ”) and Commission  Decision
2000/572/EC , which lays down animal and public health and veterinary
certification conditions for imports of meat preparations from third
countries. The amendments extend transitional periods which apply in relation
to the import of animals and goods which originate from certain third
countries and territories.

  Regulation 2 amends regulation 2 of the 2021 Regulations, which appoints the
end date for the transitional staging period provided for by Annex 6 to
Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (EUR 2017/625) as 31 December 2022. It amends
regulation 2 of the 2021 Regulations to provide that the transitional staging
period will end on 31 January 2024.

  Regulation 3 amends Article 4za of Commission Decision 2000/572, which
modifies the import conditions for imports of meat preparations from countries
and territories subject to special transitional import arrangements during the
transitional staging period in relation to animal products (EEA states, the
Faroe Islands, Greenland and Switzerland). It amends Article 4za to provide
that the import condition that meat preparations have been deep frozen at the
production plant or plants of origin does not apply until 31 January 2024,
where the production plant or plants of origin are in one of those countries
or territories.
