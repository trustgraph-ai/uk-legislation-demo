## EXPLANATORY NOTE

  (This note is not part of the Order)

This Order amends Part 1 of the Model Code of Conduct as set out in the
Schedule to the Local Authorities (Model Code of Conduct) (Wales) Order 2008
(“ the Order ”) to add corporate joint committees established under Part 5 of
the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act  2021 (asc 1)  to the list of
relevant authorities. The effect of the amendment would be to make the
mandatory Model Code of Conduct applicable to members of corporate joint

The Model Code of Conduct governs the conduct of the members of relevant
authorities in Wales.

The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact
Assessments was considered in relation to the regulations which establish
corporate joint committees and connected orders and regulations. As a result,
a regulatory impact assessment was prepared at the time of making those
establishment regulations and is relied upon for the purpose of this Order. A
