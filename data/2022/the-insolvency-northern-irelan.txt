## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Order)

  The Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (Prescribed Part) Order
(Northern Ireland) 2006 ( S.R. 2006 No. 25 ) sets out the method of
calculation of the prescribed part. The prescribed part is the part of the
property of a company that a liquidator, administrator, or receiver must
reserve for unsecured creditors, under Article 150A of the insolvency
(Northern Ireland) Order 1989, and which would otherwise be available to
satisfy claims secured by a floating charge. The prescribed part is subject to
a limit.

  This Order increases the limit on the value of the prescribed part from
£600,000 to £800,000.

  The increased limit does not apply, where the company’s net property is
available to be distributed to the holder of a first ranking floating charge
created before this Order comes into operation.

  A full impact assessment has not been produced for this rule as it has
minimal impact on the private, voluntary and public sectors.
