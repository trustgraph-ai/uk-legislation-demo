## EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Order)

These Regulations amend the Insolvency Practitioners Regulations (Northern
Ireland) 2006 (“ the principal Regulations ”).

Regulation 3 revises the definition of insolvency practitioners in regulation
2 of the principal regulations as a consequence of the ending of authorisation
of insolvency practitioners by competent authorities following repeal of
Article 352 of the 1989 Order by the Insolvency (Amendment) Act (Northern
Ireland) 2016.

Regulations 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11(a), 11(b) and 11(c) revoke provisions which
have been rendered otiose as a result of the ending of authorisation of
insolvency practitioners by competent authorities in Northern Ireland.

Regulation 6 provides for revocation of paragraph (3) in regulation 12 of the
principal regulations which has been rendered otiose by the ending of
authorisation of insolvency practitioners by competent authorities in Great
Britain.

Regulation 7 substitutes regulation 13(1) of the principal regulations to
require insolvency practitioners to maintain records sufficient to show and
explain both the administration of each case and decisions materially affect
that case. This replaces the requirement to maintain records containing
prescribed information formerly set out in Schedule 3 to the principal
regulations. Schedule 3 to the principal regulations is revoked by Regulation
12.
