## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  Section 44 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 (“ the Act ”) contains provision
relating to Statutory Sick Pay.

  Section 89(1) provides for the Act to expire at the end of the period of 2
years beginning with the day on which it was passed (25th March 2020). This is
subject to limited exceptions. Section 90 allows expiring provisions to be
extended for not more than 6 months.

  The Coronavirus Act 2020 (Extension of Provisions Relating to Statutory Sick
Pay) Order (Northern Ireland) 2022 ( S.R. 2022 No. 151 ) extended the expiry
date of section 44 to 24 th  September 2022, but that Order has not been
approved by the Assembly. The Department, however, wishes to ensure that
section 44 is extended to 24 th  September 2022 and so makes this Order. The
making of this Order renders the continued operation of  S.R. 2022 No. 151
unnecessary and so that Order is revoked by this Order.
