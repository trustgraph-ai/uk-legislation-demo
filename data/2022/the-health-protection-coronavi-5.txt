## EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International
Travel) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (the principal regulations) and
The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel, Operator Liability
and Information to Passengers) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (the
Operator Liability Regulations).

Part 2 amends the principal Regulations.

Regulation 4 extends the time for passengers to complete their Passenger
Locator Form from 2 days to 3 days.

Regulation 5 amends the information to be included in the Passenger Locator
Form.

Regulation 6 removes the requirement for a fully vaccinated person (an
eligible non-red list arrival) to book and undertake tests upon arrival in
Northern Ireland.

Regulation 7 relaxes the requirement for an unvaccinated person (a non-
eligible non-red list arrival) to book and undertake tests upon arrival in
Northern Ireland. Rather than a day 2 and day 8 test, only a day 2 test is
required. Rather than a legal obligation to self-isolate, the Department may
now issue guidance on self-isolation if a test result is positive.

Regulation 8 removes the requirement for an unvaccinated person to self-
isolate upon arrival.

Regulation 9 relaxes the requirements for workforce testing so that a test
must only be taken on day 2 now.

Regulation 10 updates the list of countries whose vaccinations are recognised
and the way in which those vaccinations are treated.

Part 3 amends the Operator Liability Regulations.

Regulation 12 introduces a new requirement upon operators of transport
services to implement and maintain systems to ensure that passengers comply
with the various travel rules. Rather than being fined for individual breaches
by passengers of these rules, the operator is now only fined if they donâ€™t
have proper systems in place.

Regulation 13 introduces a fixed penalty notice procedure for offences under
the Operator Liability Regulations. This aligns with the procedure with the
principal Regulations and allows for a fixed penalty notice to be issued
rather than every case having to be dealt with in a court. A person can always
elect to have the matter dealt with by a court. This regulation sets out the
detailed procedures involved if a fixed penalty notice is challenged etc.

Regulation 14 simplifies the requirement for operators to provide information
to passengers travelling to Northern Ireland. There are less different types
of information to be provided at different times, and there is greater
uniformity between the different ways that information may be provided.

Regulation 15 requires operators to keep records of how they have complied
with their obligation to give information to passengers.

Regulation 16 corrects minor typographical and cross-referencing errors in
previous Regulations.

Regulation 17 is a transitional provision which allows arrivals to be released
from isolation early if their country of origin is now regarded as being safe
in terms of vaccinations.

No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.
