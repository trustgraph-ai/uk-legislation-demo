  (This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend the Provision of Health Services to Persons Not

Regulation 4(1)(d) of the 2015 Regulations provides that no charge shall be
made in respect of services forming part of the health services that are
provided to a visitor for treatment in respect of a disease listed in Schedule

Schedule to insert an entry for Monkeypox. The effect is that a visitor who is
being treated in a hospital in Northern Ireland for Monkeypox will be exempt
from charges for any Health Service treatment received in respect of that
condition.
