  Schedule C1 to the Damages Act 1996, as inserted

Section 2.

      SCHEDULE C1     Setting the rate for section C1(1): Northern Ireland
Regular review of rates of return     1       1     The rate-assessor must
review any original rate of return.         2     A review under sub-paragraph
(1) must be started by the rate-assessor on the appointed day.         3
For the purposes of this paragraph, an original rate of return is—     a     a
rate of return to which paragraph 27(1) applies, or         b     the position
of there being no rate of return to which paragraph 27(1) applies.
2       1     The rate-assessor must review every subsequent rate of return.
2     A review under sub-paragraph (1) must be started by the rate-assessor—
a     in relation to the first such review—     i     on 1st July 2024, or
ii     earlier as is required by the Department of Justice;             b
in relation to any subsequent review—     i     on the day after the last day
of the 5-year period, or         ii     earlier within the 5-year period as is
required by the Department of Justice.                 3     Where a review
under sub-paragraph (1) is started earlier by virtue of sub-paragraph
(2)(a)(ii) or (2)(b)(ii), it is to be treated as an extra review that does not
affect the starting date for the first review of 1st July 2024 or the running
of the 5-year period in relation to the previous review (and no 5-year period
runs under sub-paragraph (2) in relation to the extra review).         4
For the purposes of this paragraph—     a     a subsequent rate of return is a
rate of return that is set—     i     for the time being (including by reason
of an extra review as mentioned in sub-paragraph (3)), and         ii
subsequently to an original rate of return as described in paragraph 1(3)(a)
(including as a result of a review under sub-paragraph (1) conducted from time
to time by virtue of the continuing operation of sub-paragraph (2)(a) and
(b)),             b     the 5-year period is the period of 5 years beginning
with the day on which the previous review of a rate of return must be started
(ignoring an extra review as mentioned in sub-paragraph (3)).
3       1     A review of a rate of return under paragraph 1(1) or 2(1) must
be concluded by the rate-assessor within the 90-day period.         2     For
the purposes of this paragraph, the 90-day period is the period of 90 days
beginning with the day on which the review must be started by the rate-
assessor.               Overview as to rate-setting     4       1     The
conduct by the rate-assessor of a review of a rate of return under paragraph
1(1) or 2(1) is governed by—     a     paragraphs 5 to 7,         b
paragraphs 9 and 10,         c     paragraphs 12 and 13,         d
paragraphs 19 to 21.             2     A rate of return is to be set as a
result of a review under paragraph 1(1) or 2(1) accordingly (plus see
paragraph 23 as to reporting afterwards on the conduct of such a review).
5     In a review under paragraph 1(1) or 2(1), the rate-assessor must
determine whether a rate of return to be set is to be—     a     different
from the rate of return with which the review is concerned, or         b
the same as the rate of return with which the review is concerned.
6     In a review under paragraph 1(1) or 2(1), the rate-assessor must have
regard to views—     a     of any person whom the rate-assessor chooses to
consult, and         b     of any person whose advice the rate-assessor
chooses to seek,       where received by the rate-assessor within a reasonable
time in connection with the review.           Returns-based assessment     7
1     The basis on which the rate-assessor is to make a rate determination in
a review under paragraph 1(1) or 2(1) is as set out in sub-paragraph (2).
2     A rate of return should reflect the return that could reasonably be
expected to be achieved by a person who invests—     a     in the notional
portfolio, and         b     for a period of 43 years.             3     This
is without prejudice to paragraphs 10 and 20 (with paragraph 10 to be met
before paragraph 20 is met).         4     The notional portfolio is shown in
the table in paragraph 12(3).             8     The Department of Justice may
by regulations modify a period mentioned in paragraph 7(2).         9       1
Allowance must be made by the rate-assessor for the impact of inflation on the
value of the return or investment to which paragraph 7(2) relates.         2
The impact of inflation is to be allowed for by reference to, whether
indicating an upward or downward trend—     a     the retail prices index, or
b     some published information relating to costs, earnings or other monetary
factors as is, for use instead of the retail prices index, prescribed in
regulations made by the Department of Justice.             3     In sub-
paragraph (2), “ the retail prices index ” means the general index (for all
items) published by the Statistics Board or, if that index is not published
for a relevant month, any substituted index or index figures published by that
Board.               Standard adjustments     10       1     The standard
adjustments must be made by the rate-assessor to a rate of return that would
be arrived at but for this paragraph.         2     The standard adjustments
are the deduction of—     a     0.75 of a percentage point, to represent—
i     the impact of taxation, and         ii     the costs of investment
advice and management, and             b     0.5 of a percentage point, as the
further margin involved in relation to the rate of return.                 11
1     The Department of Justice may by regulations modify a figure appearing
in paragraph 10(2)(a) or (b).         2     A figure as so modified—     a
may be zero or a positive number,         b     if not a whole number
(including zero), may comprise or incorporate a decimal fraction.
Notional investment portfolio     12       1     As for the basis on which the
rate-assessor is to proceed by virtue of paragraph 7(1), the notional
portfolio is a combination of various types of things for investment in.
2     In the table—     a     the first column shows the types of things that
the portfolio is composed of,         b     the second column shows the
percentage that each of the types of things is of the portfolio.             3
The table is as follows—           Cash or equivalents 10% Nominal gilts 15%
Index-linked gilts 10% UK equities 7.5% Overseas equities 12.5% High-yield
bonds 5% Investment-grade-credit 30% Property (heritable or moveable) 5% Other
types (see the examples) 5%             4     Examples of other types as
mentioned in the first column of the table are infrastructure, commodities,
hedge funds and absolute return funds.             13     So far as necessary,
if—     a     an entry in the first column of the table is not ascribed
meaning by regulations under paragraph 14,         b     any associated
examples are not ascribed meaning by regulations under paragraph 14,       the
entry is or (as the case may be) examples are to be interpreted by the rate-
assessor as appropriate by bringing to bear professional knowledge of what the
relevant terminology is commonly understood to mean in investment contexts.
Details within portfolio     14     The Department of Justice may by
regulations ascribe meaning to—     a     an entry in the first column of the
table in paragraph 12(3),         b     any associated examples.
15       1     The Department of Justice may by regulations—     a     as
respects the first column of the table in paragraph 12(3), add, remove or
modify an entry or any associated examples,         b     as respects the
second column of the table—     i     add or remove a figure,         ii
modify a figure.                 2     A figure so added, or as so modified—
a     may be zero or a positive number,         b     if not a whole number
(including zero), may comprise or incorporate a decimal fraction.
Hypothetical investor     16       1     Before a review under paragraph 2(1)
is due to start, the Department of Justice must consider whether regulations
under paragraph 14 or 15 are necessary for ensuring that the notional
portfolio remains suitable for investment in by a hypothetical investor.
2     In considering the matter, the Department of Justice must consult such
persons as it considers appropriate.         3     No consideration of the
matter is required ahead of an extra review as mentioned in paragraph 2(3).
17       1     A hypothetical investor is a person who falls within each of
sub-paragraphs (2) to (4).         2     A person falls within this sub-
paragraph if the person—     a     is a recipient of damages, and         b
will—     i     invest the damages, and         ii     do so as properly
advised.                 3     A person falls within this sub-paragraph if the
person—     a     has no financial resources, apart from the damages, that can
be used to meet the losses and expenses for which the damages are awarded, and
b     will make withdrawals from the investment fund deriving from investment
of the damages.             4     A person falls within this sub-paragraph if
the person is someone whose objectives are of securing that the damages will—
a     meet the losses and expenses for which the damages are awarded, and
b     be exhausted at the end of the period for which the damages are awarded.
18     For the purpose of paragraphs 16 and 17—     a     a reference to
damages is to damages of the kind mentioned in section C1(1), and         b
the damages are to be assumed to be received in a lump sum (rather than by way
of periodical payments).               Expression of rates set     19       1
A rate of return is to be set by the rate-assessor as a percentage figure.
2     The figure may be—     a     zero, or         b     a negative or
positive number.             3     If the figure is not a whole number
(including zero), the number is to comprise or incorporate a decimal fraction
of 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75.             20       1     A rate of return that would
be arrived at but for this paragraph is to be rounded up or down by the rate-
assessor to the nearest figure permitted, if necessary so as to come to—     a
a whole number (including zero), or         b     a number comprising or
incorporating a decimal fraction of 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75.             2     If
two permitted figures are equally near when rounding under sub-paragraph (1)
arises, rounding is to be to whichever of the figures is reached—     a
from the positive side of zero, by going towards (or to) zero, or         b
from the negative side of zero, by going further below zero.
Single or multiple rates     21       1     Except where the Department of
Justice by regulations requires more than one rate of return to be set by the
rate-assessor, a rate of return is to be set so as to have effect for all
cases.         2     Where more than one rate of return is set for the time
being by virtue of regulations under sub-paragraph (1), a review under
paragraph 1(1) or 2(1) is to be conducted separately in relation to each rate
of return (and a reference in paragraph 2(4)(b) to the previous review is to
be read as necessary for this).             22     Regulations under paragraph
21(1) must—     a     specify the circumstances to which each rate of return
is to relate,         b     require the rate-assessor’s report under paragraph
23 to cover each rate of return separately.               Reporting and
effective date     23       1     After a review under paragraph 1(1) or 2(1)
is concluded, the rate-assessor must send to the Department of Justice a
report on the conduct of the review.         2     The report is to be sent to
the Department of Justice without undue delay (and no later than on the last
day of the 90-day period described in paragraph 3(2)).         3     The
report is to—     a     include—     i     a rate determination made in the
review,         ii     a summary of the calculation of the rate of return
(which may be accompanied by explanatory or supporting material),
b     state the day on which the report is sent to the Department of Justice
(and the day on which the review is concluded).                 24       1
The Department of Justice must lay the report before the Northern Ireland
Assembly as soon as practicable after the day on which the Department receives
the report from the rate-assessor.         2     The rate-assessor must
publish the report on the same day as the report is laid before the Northern
Ireland Assembly by the Department of Justice.             25     A rate
determination comes into effect at the beginning of the day after the day on
which the report including the determination is laid before the Northern
Ireland Assembly by the Department of Justice.           Reimbursement of
costs     26     The Department of Justice must adequately reimburse the rate-
assessor for costs, including as to staff and outlays, incurred by the rate-
assessor in exercising the rate-assessor’s functions with respect to a review
under paragraph 1(1) or 2(1).           Transitional arrangements     27
1     This sub-paragraph applies to a rate of return—     a     prescribed by
an order under section 1(1) of the Damages Act 1996, and         b     having
effect—     i     in relation to Northern Ireland, and         ii
immediately before the appointed day.                 2     A rate of return
to which sub-paragraph (1) applies is to be treated from the appointed day as
if it were set for the purpose of section C1(1).             28       1     A
review under paragraph 1(1) of the position of there being no rate of return
cannot cause the maintaining of that position, so in conducting such a review
in relation to that position—     a     paragraphs 5(a) and 33(5)(a) are to be
read as if referring to a rate of return of some sort, and         b
paragraphs 5(b) and 33(5)(b) are to be ignored.             2     On the
question of a review under paragraph 1(1) of the position of there being no
rate of return, see paragraph 1(3)(b).             29     Paragraph 6 extends
to views received, in advance of the appointed day, in anticipation of the
starting of a review under paragraph 1(1).         30     Paragraph 26 extends
to costs incurred, in advance of the appointed day, in anticipation of the
starting of a review under paragraph 1(1).           Procedure for regulations
31       1     Regulations under this Schedule may—     a     make provision
to apply in all cases, or         b     make different provision for different
circumstances.             2     The power to make regulations under this
Schedule is exercisable by statutory rule for the purposes of the Statutory
Rules (Northern Ireland) Order 1979.         3     Regulations under this
Schedule may not be made unless a draft of the regulations has been laid
before, and approved by a resolution of, the Northern Ireland Assembly.
Interpretation of Schedule     32     In this Schedule, a reference to the
rate-assessor is to the official rate-assessor as mentioned in section C1(1).
33       1     Sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) apply for the interpretation of this
Schedule.         2     A rate of return is a rate of return for the purpose
of section C1(1).         3     A rate of return is set as a result of a
review under paragraph 1(1) or 2(1) and on the coming into effect of a rate
determination made by the rate-assessor in that review.         4     A review
of a rate of return under paragraph 1(1) or 2(1) is concluded when the rate-
assessor makes a rate determination in the review.         5     A rate
determination is a determination by the rate-assessor that is to be made in a
review under paragraph 1(1) or 2(1) of what the new rate of return is, either—
a     different from the rate of return under review, or         b     the
same as the rate of return under review.                 34     In this
Schedule—         “ the appointed day ” means the day on which the Schedule to
the Damages (Return on Investment) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 comes into
operation;           “ the Department of Justice ” means the Department of
Justice in Northern Ireland.                     .
