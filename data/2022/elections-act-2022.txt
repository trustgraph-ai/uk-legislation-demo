25.1

If controlled expenditure is incurred by or on behalf of a relevant person
during any post-commencement period in relation to which any limit is imposed
by Schedule 10 to PPERA (limits on controlled expenditure), no campaign
expenditure may be incurred during that period by or on behalf of the person.

25.2

“ Relevant person ” means a person who, immediately before the commencement
date, is both a registered party and a recognised third party.

25.3

Where campaign expenditure is incurred by or on behalf of a relevant person in
contravention of subsection  (1) , section 79(2) of PPERA (offence for
exceeding limit on campaign expenditure) applies as if campaign expenditure
had been incurred in excess of any limit imposed by Schedule 9 to PPERA (and
for this purpose references in section 79(2) of PPERA to a registered party
are to be read as references to the relevant person in its capacity as a
registered party).

25.4

See also  section 89A  of PPERA (inserted by section 26 below), which among
other things restricts the incurring of controlled expenditure by or on behalf
of a registered party which is also a third party.

A third party may not give a notification under section 88(4)(b) of PPERA
(recognised third parties: renewal of original notification) on or after the
commencement date if it is also a registered party.

In this section—

                                    “ campaign expenditure ” has the same
meaning as it has for the purposes of Part 5 of PPERA (see section 72(2) of
that Act);
“ the commencement date ” means the date on which this section comes into
force (and post-commencement, in relation to a period, means beginning on or
after that date);
“ controlled expenditure ”, “ recognised third party ” and “ third party ”
have the same meaning as they have for the purposes of Part 6 of PPERA (see
section 85 of that Act);
“ registered party ” has the same meaning as in PPERA (see section 160(1) of
that Act).
