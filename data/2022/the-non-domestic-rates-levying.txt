## EXPLANATORY NOTE

  (This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations make provision for the amount payable in certain
circumstances as non-domestic rates in respect of non-domestic subjects in
Scotland. The non-domestic rate for subjects not covered by these Regulations
is fixed by Order made under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975. For the
financial year 2022-2023, the rate is fixed by the Non-Domestic Rate
(Scotland) Order 2022 ( S.S.I. 2022/36 ).

These Regulations also make miscellaneous amendments to the Non-Domestic Rates
(Enterprise Areas) (Scotland) Regulations 2016, the Non-Domestic Rates
(Telecommunication Installations) (Scotland) Regulations 2016, the Non-
Domestic Rates (Transitional Relief) (Scotland) Regulations 2017 and the Non-
Domestic Rates (Telecommunications New Fibre Infrastructure Relief) (Scotland)
Regulations 2019.

Part 1 provides the title of these Regulations and for their commencement.

Part 2 contains provisions in respect of the levying of non-domestic rates.

Regulation 3 provides for the general reduction in rates for a ratepayer of
non-domestic subjects which individually have a rateable value of £18,000 or
less, and whose cumulative rateable value does not exceed £35,000. Regulation
3(3) sets out the reduction of either 25% or 100% depending on the value of
the subjects.

Regulation 3(4) provides for a reduction in rate relief (calculated in
accordance with regulation 3(3)) if the enactments listed in regulation
3(4)(a) or (b) already provide for a reduction or determination. Regulation
3(5) provides that no rate relief is granted in respect of lands and heritages
that are receiving relief on account of being unoccupied or are used for
payday lending.

Regulation 4 provides a formula for the additional amount payable as rates for
lands and heritages with a rateable value exceeding £51,000, but not exceeding
£95,000. Regulation 5 provides a formula for the additional amount payable as
rates for lands and heritages with a rateable value exceeding £95,000.

Regulations 3 to 5 apply to the financial year 2022-2023.

Regulation 6 allows for exemptions and discretionary reductions and
remissions.

The provisions in Part 2 of the Non-Domestic Rates (Levying and Miscellaneous
Amendments) (Scotland) Regulations 2021 are revoked by regulation 7, with a
saving provision in respect of the financial year 2021-2022.

Part 3 contains miscellaneous amendments in respect of Non-Domestic Rating
Regulations.

Regulation 8 amends the Non-Domestic Rates (Enterprise Areas) (Scotland)
Regulations 2016, which provide relief from non-domestic rates in specified
enterprise areas. The relief granted under those Regulations was due to expire
on 31 March 2022, but regulation 8 extends the relief until 31 March 2023.

Regulation 9 amends the Non-Domestic Rates (Telecommunication Installations)
(Scotland) Regulations 2016 (“ the 2016 Regulations ”). Regulation 9(2) amends
a reference to a document in the definition of a “Mobile Masts Pilot Area” in
the 2016 Regulations. These areas are either shown in a specified document
with grid coordinates or delineated on three maps named in the 2016
Regulations. A new document is being referred to.

The document and maps are available for inspection online at
https://www.gov.scot/publications/4g-infill-programme-non-domestic-rates-
relief-mobile-masts/ .

Regulation 9(3) provides relief for areas shown in the document from the
2022-23 financial year, with the 2016 Regulations continuing that relief, if
other conditions are met, until the end of the 2028-29 financial year.

Regulation 10 amends the Non-Domestic Rates (Transitional Relief) (Scotland)
Regulations 2017 (“ the 2017 Regulations ”). Paragraph (2) updates a reference
to the Non-Domestic Rates (Levying and Miscellaneous Amendments) (Scotland)
Regulations 2021 and updates the definition of “the relevant year”. The
relevant year becomes the financial year 2022-23. Paragraph (4)(a) uprates a
figure used to calculate entitlement to transitional relief and its maximum
amount. Paragraphs (3), (4)(b) and (5)(b) make amendments, namely to
regulations 8, 9 and 11 of the 2017 Regulations to reflect the changes to the
poundage and supplement references. Paragraph (6) amends regulation 12 to
reflect the availability of retail, hospitality and leisure relief, in light
of coronavirus, for the first three months of the financial year 2022-23, and
updates references to other Regulations.

Regulation 11 amends the Non-Domestic Rates (Telecommunications New Fibre
Infrastructure Relief) (Scotland) Regulations 2019. The relief granted under
those Regulations was due to expire on 31 March 2029, but regulation 11
extends the availability of the relief until 31 March 2034.
