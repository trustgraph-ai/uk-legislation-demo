## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Order)

  This Order amends Schedule 3 to the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 2005
to enable the Pensions Regulator to disclose restricted information to the
Money and Pensions Service (“MaPS”) to facilitate the exercise by MaPS of
certain functions. These are MaPS functions under—         Articles 215A to
215G of the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 in respect of which the
Pensions Dashboards Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022 have been made, and
the Financial Guidance and Claims Act 2018 in relation to the dashboards
ecosystem and pensions dashboard services.

  A pensions dashboard service is an electronic communications service
intended to enable individuals (or other authorised persons) to request and
view information relating to an individual’s pension entitlements
electronically. The dashboards ecosystem is a term used and defined in the
Pensions Dashboards Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022 for the interconnected
system that enables pensions dashboard services to work in accordance with
those Regulations.

  The functions exercised by MaPS include setting standards on matters such as
connection and security and the provision of the dashboards ecosystem
including the connection and disconnection of pension schemes to it.
