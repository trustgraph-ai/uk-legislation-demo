## EXPLANATORY NOTE

  (This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend the Council Tax (Additional Provisions for Discount
Disregards) Regulations 1992 (“ the Discount Disregards Regulations ”) and the
Council Tax (Exempt Dwellings) Order 1992 (“ the Exempt Dwellings Order ”).

Under Part 1 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 (“ the 1992 Act ”)
council tax is payable in respect of dwellings which are not exempt. The
Exempt Dwellings Order prescribes classes of dwellings which are exempt from
council tax. Section 11 of the 1992 Act makes provision for discount in the
amount of council tax payable where there is only one resident of a dwelling
or where all residents (or all but one) fall to be disregarded. Schedule 1
makes provision for persons who are to be disregarded. Regulation 3 of the
Discount Disregards Regulations prescribes additional classes of person who
are to be disregarded.

Regulation 2 amends the Discount Disregards Regulations to prescribe persons
sponsored under the Government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme as an additional
class of persons to be disregarded.

Regulation 3 amends the Exempt Dwellings Order to ensure that a person being
accommodated in an exempt dwelling under the Homes for Ukraine scheme does not
affect the exempt status of the dwelling.

A regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument amends
an existing local tax regime.
