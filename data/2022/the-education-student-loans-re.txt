Price level index value (x) Band Multiplier   x <0.3  A 0.2 0.3≤  x <0.5  B
0.4 0.5≤  x <0.7  C 0.6 0.7≤  x <0.9  D 0.8 0.9≤  x <1.1  E 1.0 1.1≤  x <1.3
F 1.2   x ≥1.3  G 1.4

11.8A.3.a

the price level value for the country in the most recent year available, and

the price level value for the United Kingdom in the same year.

Example 0.736687 is the country’s price level value and 1.058064 is the United

the percentage increase, expressed as a decimal, in the retail price index

Example 2.4% is the percentage increase in the retail price index. 2.4%

repayment threshold variable is 1.024.
