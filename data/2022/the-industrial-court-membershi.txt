## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Regulations)

  These Regulations amend the Industrial Court (Membership) Regulations
(Northern Ireland) 2011 (the “ Membership Regulations ”).

  Regulation 2 amends regulation 3 of the Membership Regulations by removing a
number of the current legislative provisions in relation to members of the
Industrial Court (the “Court”) holding and vacating office and replacing those
provisions with a reliance on each member’s terms of appointment.

  Regulation 3 contains a transitional provision for current members of the
Court.

  The Court is a non-departmental tribunal body whose main function is to
adjudicate on applications relating to the statutory recognition or
derecognition of trade unions for collective bargaining purposes, where this
cannot be agreed voluntarily.

  An impact assessment has not been produced for this statutory rule as no
impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.
