## EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (International
Travel and Operator Liability) (Scotland) Regulations 2021 (“ the
International Travel Regulations ”).

Regulation 3 amends the definition of “WHO List vaccine” in regulation 3(1) of
the International Travel Regulations to include additional vaccines (Novavax
and Covovax).

Regulation 4 amends regulation 8 of the International Travel Regulations so
that the requirement to possess notification of a negative test result on
arrival in Scotland does not apply to eligible vaccinated arrivals.

Regulation 5 amends regulation 11 of the International Travel Regulations so
that the self-isolation requirements set out in regulation 15 and 16 of those
regulations will not apply to eligible vaccinated arrivals.

Regulations 6 amends regulation 14 of the International Travel Regulations to
enable the use of lateral flow device tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in
persons who are eligible vaccinated arrivals as an alternative to existing
requirements to undertake day 2 polymerase chain reaction tests.

Regulation 7 inserts new regulations 16A and 16B into the International Travel
Regulations to deal with circumstances arising in cases enabled by the
amendments to regulation 14 described above. New regulation 16A provides for
the notification of the results of self-administered tests. New regulation 16B
requires a person to undertake a confirmatory test where the conditions set
out in that regulation are met.

Regulations 8 and 9 amend regulations 26 and 27 of the International Travel
Regulations to remove the existing requirement for eligible vaccinated
arrivals to stay in specified premises on arrival in Scotland until receiving
notification of a negative test result

Regulation 10 makes consequential amendments to regulation 30 of the
International Travel Regulations, arising from the insertion of new
regulations 16A and 16B.

Regulation 11 adds to the list of countries which are “relevant countries” so
persons who have a vaccine certificate from those countries can count as “
eligible vaccinated arrivals ” for the purposes of the International Travel
Regulations.

Regulation 12 makes consequential amendments to the required information
specified in schedule 8 of the International Travel Regulations, arising from
the amendments made by these Regulations.

Regulation 13 makes savings provision to the effect that a person arriving in
Scotland before these Regulations come into effect must comply with the
International Travel Regulations as they had effect at the time of the
person’s arrival in Scotland. The amendments made by these Regulations apply
only in relation to persons arriving in Scotland at or after 4.00 a.m. on 7
January 2022, with the exception of the amendments made by regulations 6, 7
and 10 which apply only in relation to persons arriving in Scotland at or
after 4.00 a.m. on 9 January 2022, and the amendments made by regulation 11
which apply only in relation to persons arriving in Scotland at or after 4.00
a.m. on 10 January 2022.
