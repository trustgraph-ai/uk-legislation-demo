## EXPLANATORY NOTE

    (This note is not part of the Order)

  This Order, which corresponds to an Order ( S.I. 2022/1251 ) made by the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions under sections 148AC(3) and 189(1)
and (4) of the Social Security Administration Act  1992 (c. 5)  (“ the 1992
Act ”), specifies the “revaluing percentage” as 23.5 per cent.

  The Pensions Act (Northern Ireland)  2015 (c. 5 (N.I.) ) (“ the 2015 Act ”)
created a new state pension for people reaching pensionable age on or after
6th April 2016 (see Part 1 of that Act). Pensionable age has the meaning given
by the rules in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 to the Pensions (Northern Ireland)
Order 1995 ( S.I. 1995/3213 (N.I. 22) ). The part of a person’s new state
pension based on their pre-April 2016 contribution record that exceeds the
full rate of the new state pension as at 6th April 2016 is commonly referred
to as a “ protected payment ”. Paragraph 6(5) of Schedule 1 to the 2015 Act
provides for the revaluing of protected payments by increasing these payments
by the “revaluing percentage” specified in the last Order under section 130AC
of the 1992 Act to come into operation before the person reached pensionable
age.

  Article 1(1) ensures that the revaluation of protected payments will apply
to persons reaching pensionable age on or after 11th April 2023 including
those who make an advance claim for a state pension under regulation 15(1) of
the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1987.

  Article 2 of this Order specifies the revaluing percentage as 23.5 per cent.
